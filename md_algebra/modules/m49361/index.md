Objective 1: Find the value of a function (exponential). (IA 3.5.3)Vocabulary.For the function y=f(x) , ________ is the independent variable as it can be any value in the domain and ________ is the dependent variable as its value depends on ________ .Many natural events and real-life applications can be modeled using exponential functions. For example, the growth of populations, the spread of viruses, radioactive decay and compounding interest all follow exponential patterns.

Definition An exponential function is a function of the form f(x)=ax where a>0 and a≠1 Examples: f(x)=5x,f(x)=(13)x,f(x)=2.13x Notice that in the exponential function, the variable is the exponent. In our functions so far, the variables were the base.

Medicare Premiums. The monthly Medicare Part B health-care premium for most beneficiaries ages 65 and older has increased significantly since 1975. The monthly premium has increased from about $7 in 1975 to $110.50 in 2011 (Source: Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services). The following exponential function models the premium increases:
 M(x)=7(1.080)x where x is the number of years since 1975. 
Estimate the monthly Medicare Part B premium in 1985, in 1992, and in 2002. (Note that x is the number of years since 1975, so for 1985, x=10.) Round to the nearest dollar.

What is the domain of f(x) ?

India is the second most populous country in the world with a population of about 

1.39

 billion people in 2021. The population is growing at a rate of about 

1.2%

 each yearhttp://www.worldometers.info/world-population/. Accessed February 24, 2014.. If this rate continues, the population of India will exceed China’s population by the year 

2027.

 When populations grow rapidly, we often say that the growth is “exponential,” meaning that something is growing very rapidly. To a mathematician, however, the term exponential growth has a very specific meaning. In this section, we will take a look at exponential functions, which model this kind of rapid growth.

Identifying Exponential Functions
When exploring linear growth, we observed a constant rate of change—a constant number by which the output increased for each unit increase in input. For example, in the equation 

f(x)=3x+4,

 the slope tells us the output increases by 3 each time the input increases by 1. The scenario in the India population example is different because we have a percent change per unit time (rather than a constant change) in the number of people.

Defining an Exponential FunctionA study found that the percent of the population who are vegans in the United States doubled from 2009 to 2011. In 2011, 2.5% of the population was vegan, adhering to a diet that does not include any animal products—no meat, poultry, fish, dairy, or eggs. If this rate continues, vegans will make up 10% of the U.S. population in 2015, 40% in 2019, and 80% in 2021.What exactly does it mean to grow exponentially? What does the word double have in common with percent increase? People toss these words around errantly. Are these words used correctly? The words certainly appear frequently in the media.

Percent change refers to a change based on a percent of the original amount.
Exponential growth refers to an increase based on a constant multiplicative rate of change over equal increments of time, that is, a percent increase of the original amount over time.
Exponential decay refers to a decrease based on a constant multiplicative rate of change over equal increments of time, that is, a percent decrease of the original amount over time.

For us to gain a clear understanding of exponential growth, let us contrast exponential growth with linear growth. We will construct two functions. The first function is exponential. We will start with an input of 0, and increase each input by 1. We will double the corresponding consecutive outputs. The second function is linear. We will start with an input of 0, and increase each input by 1. We will add 2 to the corresponding consecutive outputs. See .

From  we can infer that for these two functions, exponential growth dwarfs linear growth.Exponential growth refers to the original value from the range increases by the same percentage over equal increments found in the domain.
Linear growth refers to the original value from the range increases by the same amount over equal increments found in the domain.
Apparently, the difference between “the same percentage” and “the same amount” is quite significant. For exponential growth, over equal increments, the constant multiplicative rate of change resulted in doubling the output whenever the input increased by one.  For linear growth, the constant additive rate of change over equal increments resulted in adding 2 to the output whenever the input was increased by one.The general form of the exponential function is 

f(x)=a
b
x

,

 where 

a

 is any nonzero number, 

b

 is a positive real number not equal to 1.If 

b>1,

 the function grows at a rate proportional to its size.
If 

0<b<1,

 the function decays at a rate proportional to its size.
Let’s look at the function 

f(x)=

h(x)=

By definition, an exponential function has a constant as a base and an independent variable as an exponent. Thus, 

g(x)=
x
3

 does not represent an exponential function because the base is an independent variable. In fact, 

g(x)=
x
3

 is a power function.
Recall that the base b of an exponential function is always a positive constant, and 

b≠1.

 Thus, 

j(x)=

(

−2

)

x

 does not represent an exponential function because the base, 

−2,

 is less than 

0.

Evaluating Exponential Functions
Recall that the base of an exponential function must be a positive real number other than 

1.

 Why do we limit the base 

b

 to positive values? To ensure that the outputs will be real numbers. Observe what happens if the base is not positive:
Let 

b=−9

 and 

x=
1
2

.

 Then 

f(x)=f(

1
2

)=

(

−9

)

1
2

=

−9

,

 which is not a real number.

Why do we limit the base to positive values other than 

1?

 Because base 

1

 results in the constant function. Observe what happens if the base is 

1:

 

Let 

b=1.

 Then 

f(x)=
1
x

=1

 for any value of 

x.

 

To evaluate an exponential function with the form 

f(x)=
b
x

,

 we simply substitute 

x

 with the given value, and calculate the resulting power. For example:

Let 

f(x)=
2
x

.

To evaluate an exponential function with a form other than the basic form, it is important to follow the order of operations. For example:

Let 

f(x)=30

Defining Exponential GrowthBecause the output of exponential functions increases very rapidly, the term “exponential growth” is often used in everyday language to describe anything that grows or increases rapidly. However, exponential growth can be defined more precisely in a mathematical sense. If the growth rate is proportional to the amount present, the function models exponential growth.

Exponential Growth
A function that models exponential growth grows by a rate proportional to the amount present. For any real number 

x

 and any positive real numbers 

a 

 and 

b

 such that 

b≠1,

 an exponential growth function has the form 

f(x)=a
b
x

 where 

a

 is the initial or starting value of the function.
 

b

 is the growth factor or growth multiplier per unit 

x

 .

In more general terms, we have an exponential function, in which a constant base is raised to a variable exponent. To differentiate between linear and exponential functions, let’s consider two companies, A and B. Company A has 100 stores and expands by opening 50 new stores a year, so its growth can be represented by the function 

A(
x
)=100+50x.

 Company B has 100 stores and expands by increasing the number of stores by 50% each year, so its growth can be represented by the function 

B(x)=100

(

1+0.5

)

.

The graphs comparing the number of stores for each company over a five-year period are shown in . We can see that, with exponential growth, the number of stores increases much more rapidly than with linear growth.

The graph shows the numbers of stores Companies A and B opened over a five-year period.Notice that the domain for both functions is 

[0,∞),

 and the range for both functions is 

[100,∞).

 After year 1, Company B always has more stores than Company A.

Now we will turn our attention to the function representing the number of stores for Company B, 

B(x)=100

(

1+0.5

)

x

.

 In this exponential function, 100 represents the initial number of stores, 0.50 represents the growth rate, and 

1+0.5=1.5

 represents the growth factor. Generalizing further, we can write this function as 

B(x)=100

(

1.5

)

x

,

 where 100 is the initial value, 

1.5

 is called the base, and 

x

 is called the exponent.

Evaluating a Real-World Exponential Model
At the beginning of this section, we learned that the population of India was about 

1.25

 billion in the year 2013, with an annual growth rate of about 

1.2%.

 This situation is represented by the growth function 

P(t)=1.25

(

1.012

)

t

,

 where 

t

 is the number of years since 

2013.

 To the nearest thousandth, what will the population of India be in 

2031?

 

To estimate the population in 2031, we evaluate the models for 

t=18,

 because 2031 is 

18

 years after 2013. Rounding to the nearest thousandth, 

P(18)=1.25

(

1.012

)

18

≈1.549

 
There will be about 1.549 billion people in India in the year 2031.

Try It

The population of China was about 1.39 billion in the year 2013, with an annual growth rate of about 

0.6%.

 This situation is represented by the growth function 

P(t)=1.39

(

1.006

)

t

,

 where 

t

 is the number of years since 

2013.

 To the nearest thousandth, what will the population of China be for the year 2031? How does this compare to the population prediction we made for India in ?

About 

1.548

 billion people; by the year 2031, India’s population will exceed China’s by about 0.001 billion, or 1 million people.

Finding Equations of Exponential Functions
In the previous examples, we were given an exponential function, which we then evaluated for a given input. Sometimes we are given information about an exponential function without knowing the function explicitly. We must use the information to first write the form of the function, then determine the constants 

a

 and 

b,

 and evaluate the function.

How To
Given two data points, write an exponential model.
If one of the data points has the form 

(

0,a

),

 then 

a

 is the initial value. Using 

a,

 substitute the second point into the equation 

f(x)=a

(
b
)

x

,

 and solve for 

b.

 
If neither of the data points have the form 

(

0,a

),

 substitute both points into two equations with the form 

f(x)=a

(
b
)

x

.

 Solve the resulting system of two equations in two unknowns to find 

a

 and 

b.

 
Using the 

a

 and 

b

 found in the steps above, write the exponential function in the form 

f(x)=a

(
b
)

x

.

 

Writing an Exponential Model When the Initial Value Is Known
In 2006, 80 deer were introduced into a wildlife refuge. By 2012, the population had grown to 180 deer. The population was growing exponentially. Write an exponential function 

N(t)

 representing the population 

(
N
)

 of deer over time 

t.

 

We let our independent variable 

t

 be the number of years after 2006. Thus, the information given in the problem can be written as input-output pairs: (0, 80) and (6, 180). Notice that by choosing our input variable to be measured as years after 2006, we have given ourselves the initial value for the function,

The exponential model for the population of deer is

.

 (Note that this exponential function models short-term growth. As the inputs gets large, the output will get increasingly larger, so much so that the model may not be useful in the long term.)
We can graph our model to observe the population growth of deer in the refuge over time. Notice that the graph in  passes through the initial points given in the problem,

 and 

(

 We can also see that the domain for the function is

 and the range for the function is

Q&A
Do two points always determine a unique exponential function?
Yes, provided the two points are either both above the x-axis or both below the x-axis and have different x-coordinates. But keep in mind that we also need to know that the graph is, in fact, an exponential function. Not every graph that looks exponential really is exponential. We need to know the graph is based on a model that shows the same percent growth with each unit increase in 

x,

 which in many real world cases involves time.

How To
Given the graph of an exponential function, write its equation.First, identify two points on the graph. Choose the y-intercept as one of the two points whenever possible. Try to choose points that are as far apart as possible to reduce round-off error.
If one of the data points is the y-intercept 

(

0,a

)

 , then 

a

 is the initial value. Using 

a,

 substitute the second point into the equation 

f(x)=a

(
b
)

x

,

 and solve for 

b.

 
If neither of the data points have the form 

(

0,a

),

 substitute both points into two equations with the form 

f(x)=a

(
b
)

.

 Solve the resulting system of two equations in two unknowns to find

Applying the Compound-Interest Formula
Savings instruments in which earnings are continually reinvested, such as mutual funds and retirement accounts, use compound interest. The term compounding refers to interest earned not only on the original value, but on the accumulated value of the account.The annual percentage rate (APR) of an account, also called the nominal rate, is the yearly interest rate earned by an investment account. The term nominal is used when the compounding occurs a number of times other than once per year. In fact, when interest is compounded more than once a year, the effective interest rate ends up being greater than the nominal rate! This is a powerful tool for investing.We can calculate the compound interest using the compound interest formula, which is an exponential function of the variables time 

t,

 principal 

P,

 APR 

r,

 and number of compounding periods in a year 

n:

  

A(t)=P

(

 For example, observe , which shows the result of investing $1,000 at 10% for one year. Notice how the value of the account increases as the compounding frequency increases.

The Compound Interest Formula

 where
 

A(t)

 is the account value,
 

t

r

 is the annual percentage rate (APR) expressed as a decimal, and
 

n

 is the number of compounding periods in one year.

Calculating Compound Interest
If we invest $3,000 in an investment account paying 3% interest compounded quarterly, how much will the account be worth in 10 years?

Because we are starting with $3,000, 

P=3000.

 Our interest rate is 3%, so 

r=0.03.

 Because we are compounding quarterly, we are compounding 4 times per year, so 

n=4.

 We want to know the value of the account in 10 years, so we are looking for

Investigating Continuous Growth
So far we have worked with rational bases for exponential functions. For most real-world phenomena, however, e is used as the base for exponential functions. Exponential models that use 

e

 as the base are called continuous growth or decay models. We see these models in finance, computer science, and most of the sciences, such as physics, toxicology, and fluid dynamics.

The Continuous Growth/Decay Formula
For all real numbers 

t,

 and all positive numbers 

a

 and 

r,

 continuous growth or decay is represented by the formula

 

A(t)=a
e

rt

 where 

a

 is the initial value,
 

r

 is the continuous growth rate per unit time,
and 

t

 is the elapsed time.
If 

r>0

 , then the formula represents continuous growth. If 

r<0

 , then the formula represents continuous decay.

For business applications, the continuous growth formula is called the continuous compounding formula and takes the form

 

A(t)=P
e

rt

where 

P

 is the principal or the initial invested,
 

r

 is the growth or interest rate per unit time,
and 

t

 is the period or term of the investment.

How To
Given the initial value, rate of growth or decay, and time 

t,

 solve a continuous growth or decay function.Use the information in the problem to determine 

a

 , the initial value of the function.
Use the information in the problem to determine the growth rate 

r.

If the problem refers to continuous growth, then 

r>0.

 
If the problem refers to continuous decay, then 

r<0.

 

Use the information in the problem to determine the time 

t.

 
Substitute the given information into the continuous growth formula and solve for 

A(t).

 

Calculating Continuous Growth

Since the account is growing in value, this is a continuous compounding problem with growth rate

Key Concepts

An exponential function is defined as a function with a positive constant other than 

1

 raised to a variable exponent. See .
A function is evaluated by solving at a specific value. See  and .
An exponential model can be found when the growth rate and initial value are known. See .

t

 can be calculated using the compound interest formula when the principal, annual interest rate, and compounding periods are known. See .
The initial investment of an account can be found using the compound interest formula when the value of the account, annual interest rate, compounding periods, and life span of the account are known. See .
The number 

e

 is a mathematical constant often used as the base of real world exponential growth and decay models. Its decimal approximation is 

e≈2.718282.

Verbal

Explain why the values of an increasing exponential function will eventually overtake the values of an increasing linear function.

Linear functions have a constant rate of change. Exponential functions increase based on a percent of the original.

Given a formula for an exponential function, is it possible to determine whether the function grows or decays exponentially just by looking at the formula? Explain.

The Oxford Dictionary defines the word nominal as a value that is “stated or expressed but not necessarily corresponding exactly to the real value.”Oxford Dictionary. http://oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/nomina. Develop a reasonable argument for why the term nominal rate is used to describe the annual percentage rate of an investment account that compounds interest.

When interest is compounded, the percentage of interest earned to principal ends up being greater than the annual percentage rate for the investment account. Thus, the annual percentage rate does not necessarily correspond to the real interest earned, which is the very definition of nominal.

For each training session, a personal trainer charges his clients

For the following exercises, consider this scenario: For each year 

t,

 the population of a forest of trees is represented by the function 

A(t)=115

(1.025)

t

.

 In a neighboring forest, the population of the same type of tree is represented by the function 

B(t)=82

(1.029)

 (Round answers to the nearest whole number.)

Which forest’s population is growing at a faster rate?

The forest represented by the function 
 B(t)=82

   t
  
  .
 

Which forest had a greater number of trees initially? By how many?

Assuming the population growth models continue to represent the growth of the forests, which forest will have a greater number of trees after 

20

 years? By how many?

After 

t=20

 years, forest A will have 

43

 more trees than forest B.

Assuming the population growth models continue to represent the growth of the forests, which forest will have a greater number of trees after 

100

 years? By how many?

Discuss the above results from the previous four exercises. Assuming the population growth models continue to represent the growth of the forests, which forest will have the greater number of trees in the long run? Why? What are some factors that might influence the long-term validity of the exponential growth model?

Answers will vary. Sample response: For a number of years, the population of forest A will increasingly exceed forest B, but because forest B actually grows at a faster rate, the population will eventually become larger than forest A and will remain that way as long as the population growth models hold. Some factors that might influence the long-term validity of the exponential growth model are drought, an epidemic that culls the population, and other environmental and biological factors.
