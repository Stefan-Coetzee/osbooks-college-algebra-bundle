   Learning ObjectivesSolve absolute value equations (IA 2.7.1)
Identify graphs of absolute value functions (IA 3.6.2)
Objective 1: Solve absolute value equations (IA 2.7.1)Recall that in its basic form, 𝑓(𝑥)=|𝑥|, the absolute value function is one of our toolkit functions. The absolute value function is often thought of as providing the distance the number is from zero on a number line. Numerically, for whatever the input value is, the output is the magnitude of this value.
The absolute value function can be defined as a piecewise function f(x)=|x|=-x , when x<0 or x , when x≥0 Solve absolute value equations 
  ⓐ Solve for x:  |x|=5
  

  Since the absolute value of a number is its distance from 0 on the number line. Notice that both 5 and –5 are 5 units from 0 on the number line.
  

If |x|=5
x=5, or x=–5

  ⓑ Solve for x:  |2x–5|=3
  

  
In this case the number represented by 2x–5 is 3 units from zero on the number line.
So 2x–5  could either equal 3 or –3.
  
 2x-5=32x=8x=4 
 2x-5=-32x=2x=1

 Distances in deep space can be measured in all directions. As such, it is useful to consider distance in terms of absolute values. (credit: "s58y"/Flickr)Until the 1920s, the so-called spiral nebulae were believed to be clouds of dust and gas in our own galaxy, some tens of thousands of light years away. Then, astronomer Edwin Hubble proved that these objects are galaxies in their own right, at distances of millions of light years. Today, astronomers can detect galaxies that are billions of light years away. Distances in the universe can be measured in all directions. As such, it is useful to consider distance as an absolute value function. In this section, we will continue our investigation of absolute value functions.
 
  Understanding Absolute Value Recall that in its basic form 
   
    f(x)=| x |,
   the absolute value function is one of our toolkit functions. The absolute value function is commonly thought of as providing the distance the number is from zero on a number line. Algebraically, for whatever the input value is, the output is the value without regard to sign. Knowing this, we can use absolute value functions to solve some kinds of real-world problems.

Absolute Value Function
The absolute value function can be defined as a piecewise function
 
    f(x)=| x |={ 
      
       
        
         x
        
        
         
          if
        
        
         
          x≥0
        
       
       
        
         
          −x
        
        
         
          if
        
        
         
          x<0
        
       

       
   
   
  
   
     Using Absolute Value to Determine Resistance
     Electrical parts, such as resistors and capacitors, come with specified values of their operating parameters: resistance, capacitance, etc. However, due to imprecision in manufacturing, the actual values of these parameters vary somewhat from piece to piece, even when they are supposed to be the same. The best that manufacturers can do is to try to guarantee that the variations will stay within a specified range, often 
    
     ±1%,±5%,
      or 
    
     ±10%.
     
     
     Suppose we have a resistor rated at 680 ohms, 
    
     ±5%.
      Use the absolute value function to express the range of possible values of the actual resistance.
    
    
     We can find that 5% of 680 ohms is 34 ohms. The absolute value of the difference between the actual and nominal resistance should not exceed the stated variability, so, with the resistance 
    
     R
      in ohms, 
   |
        R−680 |≤34
     
     
   

  
   Try It
   
    Students who score within 20 points of 80 will pass a test. Write this as a distance from 80 using absolute value notation. 
    using the variable 
     
      p
     for passing, 
     
      | 
       p−80 |≤20
    
    
   
  
 

 
Graphing an Absolute Value Function
The most significant feature of the absolute value graph is the corner point at which the graph changes direction. This point is shown at the origin in .
   
    
   
  

   shows the graph of 
 
  y=2| 
   x–3
   |+4.
   The graph of 
 
  y=| x |
   has been shifted right 3 units, vertically stretched by a factor of 2, and shifted up 4 units. This means that the corner point is located at 
   
    (
     
      3,4
     )
   for this transformed function.
   
    
   
  

  
   
     Writing an Equation for an Absolute Value Function Given a Graph
     Write an equation for the function graphed in .

     
      
       
      
     

    
    
     The basic absolute value function changes direction at the origin, so this graph has been shifted to the right 3 units and down 2 units from the basic toolkit function. See .

    
     
      
     
    

     We also notice that the graph appears vertically stretched, because the width of the final graph on a horizontal line is not equal to 2 times the vertical distance from the corner to this line, as it would be for an unstretched absolute value function. Instead, the width is equal to 1 times the vertical distance as shown in .

    
     
      
     
    

    From this information we can write the equation
      
      
       
        
         
          
           f(x)
          
         
         
          =
         
         
          
           2|x−3|−2,
          
         
         
          
           treating the stretch as avertical stretch,or
          
         
        
        
         
          
           f(x)
          
         
         
          =
         
         
          
           |2(x−3)|−2,
          
         
         
          
           treating the stretch as ahorizontal compression.
          
         
        

       
      
     

    
     Analysis 
     Note that these equations are algebraically equivalent—the stretch for an absolute value function can be written interchangeably as a vertical or horizontal stretch or compression. Note also that if the vertical stretch factor is negative, there is also a reflection about the x-axis.
     
   

 
Q&A
  If we couldn’t observe the stretch of the function from the graphs, could we algebraically determine it?Yes. If we are unable to determine the stretch based on the width of the graph, we can solve for the stretch factor by putting in a known pair of values for 
   
    x
   and 
   
    f(x).
  
  
   
 
  f(x)=a|x−3|−2
 

Now substituting in the point (1, 2)
   
   
    
     
      
       2
      
      
       =
      
      
       
        a|1−3|−2
       
      
     
     
      
       4
      
      
       =
      
      
       
        2a
       
      
     
     
      
       a
      
      
       =
      
      
       2
      
     

    
   
  

   Try It
   
    
     Write the equation for the absolute value function that is horizontally shifted left 2 units, is vertically reflected, and vertically shifted up 3 units. 
    
      
      
       f(x)=−| 
        x+2 |+3
     
     
    
   
  

  
Q&A
  Do the graphs of absolute value functions always intersect the vertical axis? The horizontal axis?
  
   Yes, they always intersect the vertical axis. The graph of an absolute value function will intersect the vertical axis when the input is zero.
   
   No, they do not always intersect the horizontal axis. The graph may or may not intersect the horizontal axis, depending on how the graph has been shifted and reflected. It is possible for the absolute value function to intersect the horizontal axis at zero, one, or two points (see ).
   

   
    
     
    
    (a) The absolute value function does not intersect the horizontal axis. (b) The absolute value function intersects the horizontal axis at one point. (c) The absolute value function intersects the horizontal axis at two points.
   
  
Solving an Absolute Value Equation
In Other Type of Equations, we touched on the concepts of absolute value equations. Now that we understand a little more about their graphs, we can take another look at these types of equations. Now that we can graph an absolute value function, we will learn how to solve an absolute value equation. To solve an equation such as 
   
    8=| 
     2x−6 |,
 we notice that the absolute value will be equal to 8 if the quantity inside the absolute value is 8 or -8. This leads to two different equations we can solve independently. 
 
  
   
    
     
      2x−6
     
    
    
     =
    
    
     8
    
    
     
      or
     
    
    
     
      2x−6
     
    
    
     =
    
    
     
      −8
     
    
   
   
    
     
      2x
     
    
    
     =
    
    
     
      14
     
    
    
    
     
      2x
     
    
    
     =
    
    
     
      −2
     
    
   
   
    
     x
    
    
     =
    
    
     7
    
    
    
     x
    
    
     =
    
    
     
      −1
     
    
   

  
 

Knowing how to solve problems involving absolute value functions is useful. For example, we may need to identify numbers or points on a line that are at a specified distance from a given reference point.An absolute value equation is an equation in which the unknown variable appears in absolute value bars. For example, 

  
   
    

| x |=4,

    
   
   
    

  |
       2x−1
 |=3,or

    
   
   
    

      |
       5x+2
  |−4=9

    
   

  

   Solutions to Absolute Value Equations

     A
    and

    will have solutions when 

     A=B

Section Exercises

   Verbal
   
    
     How do you solve an absolute value equation?
    
   
    Isolate the absolute value term so that the equation is of the form 
     
      |A|=B.
     Form one equation by setting the expression inside the absolute value symbol, 
     
      A,
     equal to the expression on the other side of the equation, 
     
      B.
     Form a second equation by setting 
     
      A
     equal to the opposite of the expression on the other side of the equation, 
     
      −B.
     Solve each equation for the variable.
   
   
   
    
     How can you tell whether an absolute value function has two x-intercepts without graphing the function?
   
   
    
     When solving an absolute value function, the isolated absolute value term is equal to a negative number. What does that tell you about the graph of the absolute value function?
    
   
     The graph of the absolute value function does not cross the 
     
      x
     -axis, so the graph is either completely above or completely below the

    There is no solution for 
     
      a
     that will keep the function from having a 
     
      y
     -intercept. The absolute value function always crosses the 
     
      y
     -intercept when 
     
      x=0.
