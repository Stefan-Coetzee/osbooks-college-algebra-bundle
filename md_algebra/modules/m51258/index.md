We have solved linear equations, rational equations, and quadratic equations using several methods. However, there are many other types of equations, and we will investigate a few more types in this section. We will look at equations involving rational exponents, polynomial equations, radical equations, absolute value equations, equations in quadratic form, and some rational equations that can be transformed into quadratics. Solving any equation, however, employs the same basic algebraic rules. We will learn some new techniques as they apply to certain equations, but the algebra never changes.

Solving Equations Involving Rational Exponents
Rational exponents are exponents that are fractions, where the numerator is a power and the denominator is a root. For example, 
 
   
    16
   
   
    
     1
     2
    

   
  

 
 is another way of writing

 The ability to work with rational exponents is a useful skill, as it is highly applicable in calculus.We can solve equations in which a variable is raised to a rational exponent by raising both sides of the equation to the reciprocal of the exponent. The reason we raise the equation to the reciprocal of the exponent is because we want to eliminate the exponent on the variable term, and a number multiplied by its reciprocal equals 1. For example, 
 
   2
   3
  
  (
   
    
     3
     2
    

   
  )=1,
 
 
 
  3(
   
    
     1
     3
    

   
  )=1,
 
 and so on.

Rational Exponents
A rational exponent indicates a power in the numerator and a root in the denominator. There are multiple ways of writing an expression, a variable, or a number with a rational exponent:
 
 
  
   a
   
    
     m
     n
    
    
  
  =
   
    (
     
      
       a
       
        
         1
         n
        
        
      
      
    )
   m
  
  =
   
    (
     
      
       a
       m
      
      
    )
   
    
     1
     n
    
    
  
  =
   
    
     a
     m
    
    
   n
  
  =
   
    (
     
      
       a
       n
      
      
    )
   m

This equation involves rational exponents as well as factoring rational exponents. Let us take this one step at a time. First, put the variable terms on one side of the equal sign and set the equation equal to zero.

 
 
  
   
    
     
      3
       x
       
        
         3
         4
        
        
      
      −(
       
        
         x
         
          
           1
           2
          
          
        
        
      )
    
    =
    
     
      
       x
       
        
         1
         2
        
        
      
      −(
       
        
         x
         
          
           1
           2
          
          
        
        
      )
    
   
   
    
     
      3
       x
       
        
         3
         4

    =
    0
   

  

Now, it looks like we should factor the left side, but what do we factor out? We can always factor the term with the lowest exponent. Rewrite 
 
   x
   
    
     1
     2
    

   
  

 
 as 
 
   x
   
    
     2
     4
    

   
  
  .
 
 Then, factor out 
 
   x
   
    
     2
     4
    

   
  

 
 from both terms on the left.

     =
    
    
     0
    
   
   
    
     
      
       x

         4
        
        
      
      (
       
        3
         x
         
          
           1
           4
          
          
        
        −1
      )
    
    
     =
    
    
     0
    
   

  

Where did 
 
   x
   
    
     1
     4
    

   
  

 
 come from? Remember, when we multiply two numbers with the same base, we add the exponents. Therefore, if we multiply 
 
   x
   
    
     2
     4
    

   
  

 
 back in using the distributive property, we get the expression we had before the factoring, which is what should happen. We need an exponent such that when added to 
 
   2
   4
  

 
 equals 
 
   3
   4
  
  .
 
 Thus, the exponent on x in the parentheses is 
 
   1
   4
  
  .
 
 
Let us continue. Now we have two factors and can use the zero factor theorem.

Solving Equations Using Factoring
We have used factoring to solve quadratic equations, but it is a technique that we can use with many types of polynomial equations, which are equations that contain a string of terms including numerical coefficients and variables. When we are faced with an equation containing polynomials of degree higher than 2, we can often solve them by factoring.

 Setting the polynomial equal to zero gives a polynomial equation. The total number of solutions (real and complex) to a polynomial equation is equal to the highest exponent n.

Solving a Polynomial by Factoring

Notice that we have the difference of squares in the factor 
 
   x

  −16,
 which we will continue to factor and obtain two solutions. The first term, 
 5
   x

 generates, technically, two solutions as the exponent is 2, but they are the same solution.

The solutions are

Analysis 
We can see the solutions on the graph in . The x-coordinates of the points where the graph crosses the x-axis are the solutions—the x-intercepts. Notice on the graph that at the solution 
 0,
 
 the graph touches the x-axis and bounces back. It does not cross the x-axis. This is typical of double solutions.

  −9x−9=0.

This polynomial consists of 4 terms, which we can solve by grouping. Grouping procedures require factoring the first two terms and then factoring the last two terms. If the factors in the parentheses are identical, we can continue the process and solve, unless more factoring is suggested.

 Note that the highest exponent is 3 and we obtained 3 solutions. We can see the solutions, the x-intercepts, on the graph in .

Analysis 
We looked at solving quadratic equations by factoring when the leading coefficient is 1. When the leading coefficient is not 1, we solved by grouping. Grouping requires four terms, which we obtained by splitting the linear term of quadratic equations. We can also use grouping for some polynomials of degree higher than 2, as we saw here, since there were already four terms.

Solving Radical Equations
Radical equations are equations that contain variables in the radicand (the expression under a radical symbol), such as

 
 
  
   
    
     
      
       
        3x+18
      
      
    
    
     =
    
    
     x
    
   
   
    
     
      
       
        x+3
      
      
    
    
     =
    
    
     
      x−3
    
   
   
    
     
      
       
        x+5
      
      −
       
        x−3
      
      
    
    
     =
    
    
     2
    
   

  

Radical equations may have one or more radical terms, and are solved by eliminating each radical, one at a time. We have to be careful when solving radical equations, as it is not unusual to find extraneous solutions, roots that are not, in fact, solutions to the equation. These solutions are not due to a mistake in the solving method, but result from the process of raising both sides of an equation to a power. However, checking each answer in the original equation will confirm the true solutions.
Radical Equations

An equation containing terms with a variable in the radicand is called  a radical equation.
How To
Given a radical equation, solve it.
Isolate the radical expression on one side of the equal sign. Put all remaining terms on the other side.
If the radical is a square root, then square both sides of the equation. If it is a cube root, then raise both sides of the equation to the third power. In other words, for an nth root radical, raise both sides to the nth power. Doing so eliminates the radical symbol.
Solve the remaining equation.
If a radical term still remains, repeat steps 1–2.
Confirm solutions by substituting them into the original equation.

The radical is already isolated on the left side of the equal side, so proceed to square both sides.

Solving an Absolute Value Equation
Next, we will learn how to solve an absolute value equation. To solve an equation such as 
 | 
   2x−6 |=8,
 we notice that the absolute value will be equal to 8 if the quantity inside the absolute value bars is 
 8
 
 or 
 −8.
 
 This leads to two different equations we can solve independently.

 
 
  
   
    
     
      2x−6
    
    
     =
    
    
     8
    
    
     
      or

     =

Knowing how to solve problems involving absolute value functions is useful. For example, we may need to identify numbers or points on a line that are at a specified distance from a given reference point.

Absolute Value Equations
The absolute value of x is written as 
 | x |.
 
 It has the following properties:

 
 
  
   
    
     
      If x≥0,then |x|=x.
     
    
   
   
    
     
      If x<0,then |x|=−x.
     
    
   

  
 
 
For real numbers 
 A
 
 and 
 B,
 
 an equation of the form 
 | A |=B,
 
 with 
 B≥0,
 
 will have solutions when 
 A=B
 
 or 
 A=−B.
 
 If 
 B<0,
 
 the equation

Solving Other Types of Equations
There are many other types of equations in addition to the ones we have discussed so far. We will see more of them throughout the text. Here, we will discuss equations that are in quadratic form, and rational equations that result in a quadratic.

Solving Equations in Quadratic Form
Equations in quadratic form are equations with three terms. The first term has a power other than 2. The middle term has an exponent that is one-half the exponent of the leading term. The third term is a constant. We can solve equations in this form as if they were quadratic. A few examples of these equations include 
 
   x
   4
  
  −5
   x
   2
  
  +4=0,
   x
   6
  
  +7
   x
   3
  
  −8=0,
 and 
 
   x
   
    
     2
     3
    
    
  
  +4
   x
   
    
     1
     3
    
    
  
  +2=0.
 In each one, doubling the exponent of the middle term equals the exponent on the leading term. We can solve these equations by substituting a variable for the middle term.

Quadratic Form
If the exponent on the middle term is one-half of the exponent on the leading term, we have an equation in quadratic form, which we can solve as if it were a quadratic. We substitute a variable for the middle term to solve equations in quadratic form.

How To
Given an equation quadratic in form, solve it.

Identify the exponent on the leading term and determine whether it is double the exponent on the middle term.
If it is, substitute a variable, such as u, for the variable portion of the middle term.
Rewrite the equation so that it takes on the standard form of a quadratic.
Solve using one of the usual methods for solving a quadratic.
Replace the substitution variable with the original term.
Solve the remaining equation.

Solving a Fourth-degree Equation in Quadratic Form
Solve this fourth-degree equation: 
 3
   x
   4
  
  −2
   x
   2
  
  −1=0.

This equation fits the main criteria, that the power on the leading term is double the power on the middle term. Next, we will make a substitution for the variable term in the middle. Let 
 u=
   x
   2
  
  .
 
 Rewrite the equation in u.
 
 
  3
   u
   2
  
  −2u−1=0

Now solve the quadratic.

       2
      
      −2u−1

      )
    
    
     =
    
    
     0

  )−12=0.
 
 

This equation contains a binomial in place of the single variable. The tendency is to expand what is presented. However, recognizing that it fits the criteria for being in quadratic form makes all the difference in the solving process. First, make a substitution, letting 
 u=x+2.
 
 Then rewrite the equation in u.

 
 
  
   
    
     
      
       u
       2
      
      +11u−12

      (u+12)(u−1)
    
    
     =
    
    
     0
    
   

  

Solve using the zero-factor property and then replace u with the original expression.

 
 
  
   
    
     
      u+12
    
    
     =

     =

Solving Rational Equations Resulting in a Quadratic
Earlier, we solved rational equations. Sometimes, solving a rational equation results in a quadratic. When this happens, we continue the solution by simplifying the quadratic equation by one of the methods we have seen. It may turn out that there is no solution.

 Then, the LCD is 
 (
   
    x+1
   
  )(
   
    x−1

 Next, we multiply the whole equation by the LCD.

Key Concepts

Rational exponents can be rewritten several ways depending on what is most convenient for the problem. To solve, both sides of the equation are raised to a power that will render the exponent on the variable equal to 1. See , , and .
Factoring extends to higher-order polynomials when it involves factoring out the GCF or factoring by grouping. See  and .
We can solve radical equations by isolating the radical and raising both sides of the equation to a power that matches the index. See  and .
To solve absolute value equations, we need to write two equations, one for the positive value and one for the negative value. See .
Equations in quadratic form are easy to spot, as the exponent on the first term is double the exponent on the second term and the third term is a constant. We may also see a binomial in place of the single variable. We use substitution to solve. See  and .
Solving a rational equation may also lead to a quadratic equation or an equation in quadratic form. See .

Section Exercises

Verbal
In a radical equation, what does it mean if a number is an extraneous solution?
This is not a solution to the radical equation, it is a value obtained from squaring both sides and thus changing the signs of an equation which has caused it not to be a solution in the original equation.
Explain why possible solutions must be checked in radical equations.

      2
     
    

   
  

 
 and keeps getting an ERROR message. What mistake are they probably making?
They are probably trying to enter negative 9, but taking the square root of 
 −9
 
 is not a real number. The negative sign is in front of this, so your friend should be taking the square root of 9, cubing it, and then putting the negative sign in front, resulting in 
 −27.
