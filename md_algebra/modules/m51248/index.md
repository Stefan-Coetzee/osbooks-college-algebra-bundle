    1. Rework each of the examples my instructor did in class.
    
    
    
  
  
    2. Create note cards to help in memorizing important formulas and problem-solving strategies for the exam.
    
    
    
  
  
    3. Create a study schedule for each math exam and begin to study for the exam at least one week prior to the date. Spaced practice over 5-7 days is much more effective than cramming material in 1-2 sessions.
    
    
    
  
  
    4. Work the review exercises at the end of each chapter of the text.
    
    
    
  
  
    5. Visit my instructor’s office hours when I need assistance in preparing for an exam.
    
    
    
  
  
    6. Spend time on note interactions (see the section on Cornell notes) each day.
    
    
    
  
  
    7. Create a practice test using the questions I identified in my class notes (see the section on Cornell notes) and take it the week before the exam.
    
    
    
  
  
    8. Review each of the student learning objectives at the beginning of all sections covered on the exam and use this list as a checklist for exam preparation.
    
    
    
  
  
    9. Ask your instructor how many questions will be on the exam and if they award partial credit for work shown.
    
    
    
  
  
    10. Work through the practice test at the end of each chapter of the text.
    
    
    
  
  
    11. Get a good night’s sleep the night before my exam.
    
    
    
  
  
    12. Come to each exam prepared with a goal of earning an A.

    14. Arrive or log in early to class on exam days.
    
    
    
  
  
    15. Keep my phone put away in my bag during exams to avoid distractions.
    
    
    
  
  
    16. Try to relax and take a few deep breaths before beginning the exam.
    
    
    
  
  
    17. Use a pencil so that I can make corrections neatly. 
    
    
    
  
  
    18. Read through all directions before beginning the exam.
    
    
    
  
  
    19. Write formulas that are memorized in the margins, top or back of the test to reference when needed.
    
    
    
  
  
    20. Scan through my entire test before beginning and start off working on a problem I am confident in solving.
    
    
    
  
  
    21. Work each of the questions that I find easier first.
    
    
    
  
  
    22. Keep track of time. Do a quick assessment of how much time should be spent on each question.
    
    
    
  
  
    23. Try different approaches to solve when I get stuck on a problem.
    
    
    
  
  
    24. Draw a diagram when solving an application problem.
    
    
    
  
  
    25. Do some work on each question.
    
    
    
  
  
    26. Work neatly and show all steps.
    
    
    
  
  
    27. Make sure to attach units to final answers when units are given in the problem. (for example: cm, $, or feet/second)
    
    
    
  
  
    28. Stay working for the entire class session or online exam session. If finished early I use the additional time to review my work and check answers.
    
    
    
  
  
    29. Circle final answers or write each on the answer blank.

    31. Keep my old exams in a binder or notebook and use this assessment to review for my final
exam.
    
    
    
  
  
    32. Take responsibility for my exam performance and try to learn from the experience.
    
    
    
  
  
    33. Reflect on the test taking experience and make a list for yourself on what to do differently next time.

A pastry shop has fixed costs of 
 $280
 
 per week and variable costs of 
 $9
 
 per box of pastries. The shop’s costs per week in terms of 
 x,
 
 the number of boxes made, is 
 280+9x.
 
 We can divide the costs per week by the number of boxes made to determine the cost per box of pastries.

Notice that the result is a polynomial expression divided by a second polynomial expression. In this section, we will explore quotients of polynomial expressions.

Simplifying Rational Expressions
The quotient of two polynomial expressions is called a rational expression. We can apply the properties of fractions to rational expressions, such as simplifying the expressions by canceling common factors from the numerator and the denominator. To do this, we first need to factor both the numerator and denominator. Let’s start with the rational expression shown.
 
 
  
   
    
     x
     2
    
    +8x+16
   
   
    
     x
     2
    
    +11x+28
   
  

 

We can factor the numerator and denominator to rewrite the expression.
 
 
  
   
    
     
      (x+4)
     
     2
    

   
   
    (x+4)(x+7)
   
  

 

Then we can simplify that expression by canceling the common factor 
 (
   
    x+4
   
  ).
 

 
 
  
   
    x+4
   
   
    x+7

Analysis 
We can cancel the common factor because any expression divided by itself is equal to 1.

 

Q&A

Can the 
 
   x
   2
  

 
 term be cancelled in ?
No. A factor is an expression that is multiplied by another expression. The 
 
   x
   2
  

 
 term is not a factor of the numerator or the denominator.

Multiplying Rational Expressions
Multiplication of rational expressions works the same way as multiplication of any other fractions. We multiply the numerators to find the numerator of the product, and then multiply the denominators to find the denominator of the product. Before multiplying, it is helpful to factor the numerators and denominators just as we did when simplifying rational expressions. We are often able to simplify the product of rational expressions.

Dividing Rational Expressions
Division of rational expressions works the same way as division of other fractions. To divide a rational expression by another rational expression, multiply the first expression by the reciprocal of the second. Using this approach, we would rewrite

  ÷

Adding and Subtracting Rational Expressions
Adding and subtracting rational expressions works just like adding and subtracting numerical fractions. To add fractions, we need to find a common denominator. Let’s look at an example of fraction addition.

We have to rewrite the fractions so they share a common denominator before we are able to add. We must do the same thing when adding or subtracting rational expressions.
The easiest common denominator to use will be the least common denominator, or LCD. The LCD is the smallest multiple that the denominators have in common. To find the LCD of two rational expressions, we factor the expressions and multiply all of the distinct factors. For instance, if the factored denominators were 
 (x+3)(x+4)
 
 and 
 (x+4)(x+5),
 
 then the LCD would be 
 (x+3)(x+4)(x+5).
 

Once we find the LCD, we need to multiply each expression by the form of 1 that will change the denominator to the LCD. We would need to multiply the expression with a denominator of 
 (x+3)(x+4)
 
 by 
 
   
    x+5
   
   
    x+5
   
  

 
 and the expression with a denominator of 
 (x+4)(x+5)
 
 by 
 
   
    x+3
   
   
    x+3
   
  
  .
 

How To
Given two rational expressions, add or subtract them.

Factor the numerator and denominator.
Find the LCD of the expressions.
Multiply the expressions by a form of 1 that changes the denominators to the LCD.
Add or subtract the numerators.
Simplify.

Adding Rational Expressions
Add the rational expressions:
 
 
  
   5
   x
  
  +
   6
   y
  

 

First, we have to find the LCD. In this case, the LCD will be 
 xy.
 
 We then multiply each expression by the appropriate form of 1 to obtain 
 xy
 
 as the denominator for each fraction.

    +
     
      6x
     
     
      xy
     
    

   
  
 

Now that the expressions have the same denominator, we simply add the numerators to find the sum.
 
 
  
   
    6x+5y

Simplifying Complex Rational Expressions
A complex rational expression is a rational expression that contains additional rational expressions in the numerator, the denominator, or both. We can simplify complex rational expressions by rewriting the numerator and denominator as single rational expressions and dividing. The complex rational expression 
 
   a
   
    
     1
     b
    
    +c
   
  

 
 can be simplified by rewriting the numerator as the fraction 
 
   a
   1
  

 
 and combining the expressions in the denominator as 
 
   
    1+bc
   
   b
  
  .
 
 We can then rewrite the expression as a multiplication problem using the reciprocal of the denominator. We get 
 
   a
   1
  
  ⋅
   b
   
    1+bc
   
  
  ,
 
 which is equal to 
 
   
    ab
   
   
    1+bc
   
  
  .
 

How To

Section Exercises
Verbal
How can you use factoring to simplify rational expressions?
 You can factor the numerator and denominator to see if any of the terms can cancel one another out.
How do you use the LCD to combine two rational expressions?
Tell whether the following statement is true or false and explain why: You only need to find the LCD when adding or subtracting rational expressions.
 True. Multiplication and division do not require finding the LCD because the denominators can be combined through those operations, whereas addition and subtraction require like terms.
