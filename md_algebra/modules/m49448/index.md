Objective 1: Solve counting problems using the addition principle.
==================================================================
In probability theory, an **outcome** is a possible result of an experiment or trial.
In probability theory, an **event** is a set of outcomes of an experiment.
**Disjoint events** cannot happen at the same time. In other words, they are **mutually exclusive**.

The Addition Principle
======================
The **Addition Principle**states that if one event can occur in A ways (A outcomes) and a second event can occur in B ways (B outcomes) and both events cannot occur at the same time (A and B disjoints)
then there are A + B ways (A+B outcomes) for the first event or the second event to occur.The *addition principle* applies when we are making *only one selection*.

ⓐ
There are 7 ways of picking a red marble and 5 ways of picking a green marble and we cannot pick a red and a green at the same time. Therefore, there are 7+5 = 12 ways of picking a marble.

ⓑ
There are 3 negative numbers in A and 3 even numbers in A and the even numbers are not negative. Therefore, there are 3+3 = 6 ways of choosing a negative or an even number from A.

ⓒ

========================================================================

The Multiplication Principle
============================
The **Multiplication Principle** states that if one event can occur in A ways (A outcomes) and a second event can occur in B ways (B outcomes) after the first event has occurred then the two events can occur in $\text{A}\cdot \text{B}$ ways. This is also known as the Fundamental Counting Principle.

The *Multiplication Principle* applies when we are making *more than one selection*.

We encounter a wide variety of counting problems every day. There is a branch of mathematics devoted to the study of counting problems such as this one. Other applications of counting include secure passwords, horse racing outcomes, and college scheduling choices. We will examine this type of mathematics in this section.

Using the Addition Principle
============================

The company that sells customizable cases offers cases for tablets and smartphones. There are 3 supported tablet models and 5 supported smartphone models. The *Addition Principle* tells us that we can add the number of tablet options to the number of smartphone options to find the total number of options. By the Addition Principle, there are 8 total options, as we can see in .

The Addition Principle
======================

According to the **Addition Principle**, if one event can occur in $m$ ways and a second event with no common outcomes can occur in $n$ ways, then the first *or* second event can occur in $m+n$ ways.

Using the Addition Principle

Using the Multiplication Principle
==================================

The *Multiplication Principle* applies when we are making more than one selection. Suppose we are choosing an appetizer, an entrée, and a dessert. If there are 2 appetizer options, 3 entrée options, and 2 dessert options on a fixed-price dinner menu, there are a total of 12 possible choices of one each as shown in the tree diagram in .

\n\n![Image](../../media/CNX_Precalc_Figure_11_05_003.jpg)\n\nThe possible choices are:
soup, chicken, cake
soup, chicken, pudding
soup, fish, cake
soup, fish, pudding
soup, steak, cake
soup, steak, pudding
salad, chicken, cake
salad, chicken, pudding
salad, fish, cake
salad, fish, pudding
salad, steak, cake
salad, steak, pudding
We can also find the total number of possible dinners by multiplying.
We could also conclude that there are 12 possible dinner choices simply by applying the Multiplication Principle.
 $$
\begin{array}{llll}\#\phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}\text{of\ appetizer\ options\}\times \hfill & \#\phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}\text{of\ entree\ options\}\times \hfill & \#\phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}\text{of\ dessert\ options}\hfill & \hfill \\ \phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}\text{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \}2\phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}\text{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \}\times \hfill & \phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}\text{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \}3\phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}\text{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \}\times \hfill & \phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}\text{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \}2\hfill & =12\hfill \end{array}
$$ 

The Multiplication Principle
============================

According to the **Multiplication Principle**, if one event can occur in $m$ ways and a second event can occur in $n$ ways after the first event has occurred, then the two events can occur in $m\times n$ ways. This is also known as the **Fundamental Counting Principle**.

Using the Multiplication Principle
==================================

There are 60 possible breakfast specials.

Finding the Number of Permutations of *n* Distinct Objects
==========================================================

The Multiplication Principle can be used to solve a variety of problem types. One type of problem involves placing objects in order. We arrange letters into words and digits into numbers, line up for photographs, decorate rooms, and more. An ordering of objects is called a **permutation**.

Finding the Number of Permutations of *n* Distinct Objects Using the Multiplication Principle
=============================================================================================
To solve permutation problems, it is often helpful to draw line segments for each option. That enables us to determine the number of each option so we can multiply. For instance, suppose we have four paintings, and we want to find the number of ways we can hang three of the paintings in order on the wall. We can draw three lines to represent the three places on the wall.

![Image](../../media/CNX_Precalc_Figure_11_05_005.jpg)

There are four options for the first place, so we write a 4 on the first line.

![Four times two blanks spots.](../../media/CNX_Precalc_Figure_11_05_006.jpg)

After the first place has been filled, there are three options for the second place so we write a 3 on the second line.

![Four times three times one blank spot.](../../media/CNX_Precalc_Figure_11_05_007.jpg)

After the second place has been filled, there are two options for the third place so we write a 2 on the third line. Finally, we find the product.

![Image](../../media/CNX_Precalc_Figure_11_05_008.jpg)

There are 24 possible permutations of the paintings.

How To
*Given* $n$ *distinct options, determine how many permutations there are.*

Determine how many options there are for the first situation.
Determine how many options are left for the second situation.
Continue until all of the spots are filled.
Multiply the numbers together.

ⓒHow many ways can all nine swimmers line up for a photo?

ⓐDraw lines for each place.
![Image](../../media/CNX_Precalc_Figure_11_05_009.jpg)

There are 9 options for first place. Once someone has won first place, there are 8 remaining options for second place. Once first and second place have been won, there are 7 remaining options for third place.

![Image](../../media/CNX_Precalc_Figure_11_05_010.jpg)

Multiply to find that there are 504 ways for the swimmers to place.

ⓑDraw lines for describing each place.
![Image](../../media/CNX_Precalc_Figure_11_05_011.jpg)

We know Ariel must win first place, so there is only 1 option for first place. There are 8 remaining options for second place, and then 7 remaining options for third place.

![Image](../../media/CNX_Precalc_Figure_11_05_012.jpg)

Multiply to find that there are 56 ways for the swimmers to place if Ariel wins first.

Finding the Number of Permutations of *n* Distinct Objects Using a Formula
==========================================================================
For some permutation problems, it is inconvenient to use the Multiplication Principle because there are so many numbers to multiply. Fortunately, we can solve these problems using a formula. Before we learn the formula, let’s look at two common notations for permutations. If we have a set of $n$ objects and we want to choose $r$ objects from the set in order, we write $P(n,r).$ Another way to write this is $n{P}_{r},$ a notation commonly seen on computers and calculators. To calculate $P(n,r),$ we begin by finding $n!,$ the number of ways to line up all $n$ objects. We then divide by $\left(n-r\right)!$ to cancel out the $\left(n-r\right)$ items that we do not wish to line up.
Let’s see how this works with a simple example. Imagine a club of six people. They need to elect a president, a vice president, and a treasurer. Six people can be elected president, any one of the five remaining people can be elected vice president, and any of the remaining four people could be elected treasurer. The number of ways this may be done is $6\times 5\times 4=120.$ Using factorials, we get the same result.
 $$
\frac{6!}{3!}=\frac{6\xb75\xb74\xb73!}{3!}=6\xb75\xb74=120
$$ There are 120 ways to select 3 officers in order from a club with 6 members. We refer to this as a permutation of 6 taken 3 at a time. The general formula is as follows.

 $$
P(n,r)=\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}
$$ Note that the formula stills works if we are choosing *all* $n$ objects and placing them in order. In that case we would be dividing by $\left(n-n\right)!$ or $0!,$ which we said earlier is equal to 1. So the number of permutations of $n$ objects taken $n$ at a time is $\frac{n!}{1}$ or just $n!\text{.}$

Formula for Permutations of *n* Distinct Objects
================================================

Given $n$ distinct objects, the number of ways to select $r$ objects from the set in order is

 $$
P(n,r)=\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}
$$ 

How To
*Given a word problem, evaluate the possible permutations.*

Identify $n$ from the given information.
Identify $r$ from the given information.

Finding the Number of Permutations Using the Formula
====================================================

A professor is creating an exam of 9 questions from a test bank of 12 questions. How many ways can she select and arrange the questions?

Substitute $n=12$ and $r=9$ into the permutation formula and simplify.

 $$
\begin{array}{l}\phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}\text\ P(n,r)=\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}\phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}\hfill \\ P(12,9)=\frac{12!}{(12-9)!}=\frac{12!}{3!}=79\text{,}833\text{,}600\hfill \end{array}
$$
There are 79,833,600  possible permutations of exam questions!

Analysis
========

We can also use a calculator to find permutations. For this problem, we would enter 12, press the ${\phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}}_{n}{P}_{r}$
function, enter 9, and then press the equal sign. The ${\phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}}_{n}{P}_{r}$
function may be located under the MATH menu with probability commands.

Q&A
*Could we have solved  using the Multiplication Principle?*

*Yes. We could have multiplied* $12\cdot 11\cdot 10\cdot 9\cdot 8\cdot 7\cdot 6\cdot 5\cdot 4$ *to find the same answer*.

$P(7,5)=2,520$

Find the Number of Combinations Using the Formula
=================================================
So far, we have looked at problems asking us to put objects in order. There are many problems in which we want to select a few objects from a group of objects, but we do not care about the order. When we are selecting objects and the order does not matter, we are dealing with **combinations**. A selection of $r$ objects from a set of $n$ objects where the order does not matter can be written as $C(n,r).$ Just as with permutations, $\text{C}(n,r)$ can also be written as ${\phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}}_{n}{C}_{r}.$ In this case, the general formula is as follows.

 $$
\text{C}(n,r)=\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
$$ An earlier problem considered choosing 3 of 4 possible paintings to hang on a wall. We found that there were 24 ways to select 3 of the 4 paintings in order. But what if we did not care about the order? We would expect a smaller number because selecting paintings 1, 2, 3 would be the same as selecting paintings 2, 3, 1. To find the number of ways to select 3 of the 4 paintings, disregarding the order of the paintings, divide the number of permutations by the number of ways to order 3 paintings. There are $3!=3\xb72\xb71=6$ ways to order 3 paintings. There are $\frac{24}{6},$ or 4 ways to select 3 of the 4 paintings. This number makes sense because every time we are selecting 3 paintings, we are *not* selecting 1 painting. There are 4 paintings we could choose *not* to select, so there are 4 ways to select 3 of the 4 paintings.

Formula for Combinations of *n* Distinct Objects
================================================

Given $n$ distinct objects, the number of ways to select $r$ objects from the set is

 $$
\text{C}(n,r)=\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
$$ 

How To
*Given a number of options, determine the possible number of combinations.*

Identify $n$ from the given information.
Identify $r$ from the given information.
Replace $n$ and $r$ in the formula with the given values.
Evaluate.

====================================================

A fast food restaurant offers five side dish options. Your meal comes with two side dishes.

ⓐHow many ways can you select your side dishes?
ⓑHow many ways can you select 3 side dishes?

ⓐWe want to choose 2 side dishes from 5 options.
 $$
\text{C}(5,2)=\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!}=10
$$ 
ⓑWe want to choose 3 side dishes from 5 options.
 $$
\text{C}(5,3)=\frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!}=10
$$ 

Analysis
========

We can also use a graphing calculator to find combinations. Enter 5, then press ${\phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}}_{n}{C}_{r},$ enter 3, and then press the equal sign. The ${\phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}}_{n}{C}_{r},$ function may be located under the MATH menu with probability commands.

Q&A
*Is it a coincidence that parts (a) and (b) in  have the same answers?*

*No. When we choose r objects from n objects, we are *not* choosing $(n\u2013r)$ objects. Therefore, $C(n,r)=C(n,n\u2013r).$*

$C(10,3)=120$

Finding the Number of Subsets of a Set
======================================

We have looked only at combination problems in which we chose exactly $r$ objects. In some problems, we want to consider choosing every possible number of objects. Consider, for example, a pizza restaurant that offers 5 toppings. Any number of toppings can be ordered. How many different pizzas are possible?
To answer this question, we need to consider pizzas with any number of toppings. There is $C(5,0)=1$ way to order a pizza with no toppings. There are $C(5,1)=5$ ways to order a pizza with exactly one topping. If we continue this process, we get
 $C(5,0)+C(5,1)+C(5,2)+C(5,3)+C(5,4)+C(5,5)=32$ There are 32 possible pizzas. This result is equal to ${2}^{5}.$

We are presented with a sequence of choices. For each of the $n$ objects we have two choices: include it in the subset or not. So for the whole subset we have made $n$ choices, each with two options. So there are a total of $2\xb72\xb72\xb7\dots \xb72$ possible resulting subsets, all the way from the empty subset, which we obtain when we say “no” each time, to the original set itself, which we obtain when we say “yes” each time.

Finding the Number of Permutations of *n* Non-Distinct Objects
==============================================================

We have studied permutations where all of the objects involved were distinct. What happens if some of the objects are indistinguishable? For example, suppose there is a sheet of 12 stickers. If all of the stickers were distinct, there would be $12!$ ways to order the stickers. However, 4 of the stickers are identical stars, and 3 are identical moons. Because all of the objects are not distinct, many of the $12!$ permutations we counted are duplicates. The general formula for this situation is as follows.
 $$
\frac{n!}{{r}_{1}!{r}_{2}!\dots {r}_{k}!}
$$ In this example, we need to divide by the number of ways to order the 4 stars and the ways to order the 3 moons to find the number of unique permutations of the stickers. There are $4!$ ways to order the stars and $3!$ ways to order the moon.
 $$
\frac{12!}{4!3!}=3\text{,}326\text{,}400
$$
There are 3,326,400 ways to order the sheet of stickers.

Formula for Finding the Number of Permutations of *n* Non-Distinct Objects
==========================================================================

If there are $n$ elements in a set and ${r}_{1}$ are alike, ${r}_{2}$ are alike, ${r}_{3}$ are alike, and so on through ${r}_{k},$ the number of permutations can be found by

Use the Addition Principle of counting to explain how many ways event $A\phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}\text{or\}B$ can occur.

There are $m+n$ ways for either event $A$ or event $B$ to occur.

Use the Multiplication Principle of counting to explain how many ways event $A\phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}\text{and\}B$ can occur.

Answer the following questions.

When given two separate events, how do we know whether to apply the Addition Principle or the Multiplication Principle when calculating possible outcomes? What conjunctions may help to determine which operations to use?

The addition principle is applied when determining the total possible of outcomes of either event occurring. The multiplication principle is applied when determining the total possible outcomes of both events occurring. The word “or” usually implies an addition problem. The word “and” usually implies a multiplication problem.

Describe how the permutation of $n$ objects differs from the permutation of choosing $r$ objects from a set of $n$ objects. Include how each is calculated.

What is the term for the arrangement that selects $r$ objects from a set of $n$ objects when the order of the $r$ objects is not important? What is the formula for calculating the number of possible outcomes for this type of arrangement?

A combination; $C(n,r)=\frac{n!}{(n-r)!r!}$

**Addition Principle**
if one event can occur in $m$ ways and a second event with no common outcomes can occur in $n$ ways, then the first or second event can occur in $m+n$ ways

**combination**
a selection of objects in which order does not matter

**Fundamental Counting Principle**
if one event can occur in $m$ ways and a second event can occur in $n$ ways after the first event has occurred, then the two events can occur in $m\times n$ ways; also known as the Multiplication Principle

**Multiplication Principle**
if one event can occur in $m$ ways and a second event can occur in $n$ ways after the first event has occurred, then the two events can occur in $m\times n$ ways; also known as the Fundamental Counting Principle
