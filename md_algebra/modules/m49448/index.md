## Learning Objectives

Solve counting problems using the addition principle.
Solve counting problems using the multiplication principle.

## Objective 1: Solve counting problems using the addition principle.
In probability theory, an **outcome** is a possible result of an experiment or trial.

In probability theory, an **event** is a set of outcomes of an experiment.

**Disjoint events** cannot happen at the same time. In other words, they are **mutually exclusive**.

>
>
> **The Addition Principle**
>
> The **Addition Principle**states that if one event can occur in A ways (A outcomes) and a second event can occur in B ways (B outcomes) and both events cannot occur at the same time (A and B disjoints)
> then there are A + B ways (A+B outcomes) for the first event or the second event to occur.

The *addition principle* applies when we are making *only one selection*.

1. **Solve counting problems using the addition principle.**     ⓐ Seven red and five green marbles are placed in a bag. How many marbles are there to choose from?         ⓑ Let the set A = {−5,−3,−1,2,3,4,5,6}.  How many ways are there to choose a negative or an even number from A?       ⓒ A student is shopping for a new computer. He is deciding among 2 desktop computers and 3 laptop computers. What is the total number of computer options?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

ⓐ
There are 7 ways of picking a red marble and 5 ways of picking a green marble and we cannot pick a red and a green at the same time. Therefore, there are 7+5 = 12 ways of picking a marble.

ⓑ
There are 3 negative numbers in A and 3 even numbers in A and the even numbers are not negative. Therefore, there are 3+3 = 6 ways of choosing a negative or an even number from A.

ⓒ
There are 2 options for a desktop and 3 options for a laptop and the student is shopping for one computer. So, he cannot pick both. Therefore, there are 2+3 = 5 total computer options.

A new company sells customizable cases for tablets and smartphones. Each case comes in a variety of colors and can be personalized for an additional fee with images or a monogram. A customer can choose not to personalize or could choose to have one, two, or three images or a monogram. The customer can choose the order of the images and the letters in the monogram. The company is working with an agency to develop a marketing campaign with a focus on the huge number of options they offer. Counting the possibilities is challenging!

We encounter a wide variety of counting problems every day. There is a branch of mathematics devoted to the study of counting problems such as this one. Other applications of counting include secure passwords, horse racing outcomes, and college scheduling choices. We will examine this type of mathematics in this section.

# Using the Addition Principle
The company that sells customizable cases offers cases for tablets and smartphones. There are 3 supported tablet models and 5 supported smartphone models. The *Addition Principle* tells us that we can add the number of tablet options to the number of smartphone options to find the total number of options. By the Addition Principle, there are 8 total options, as we can see in .

# Using the Multiplication Principle
The *Multiplication Principle* applies when we are making more than one selection. Suppose we are choosing an appetizer, an entrée, and a dessert. If there are 2 appetizer options, 3 entrée options, and 2 dessert options on a fixed-price dinner menu, there are a total of 12 possible choices of one each as shown in the tree diagram in .

![Image](../../media/CNX_Precalc_Figure_11_05_003.jpg)

The possible choices are:
soup, chicken, cake
soup, chicken, pudding
soup, fish, cake
soup, fish, pudding
soup, steak, cake
soup, steak, pudding
salad, chicken, cake
salad, chicken, pudding
salad, fish, cake
salad, fish, pudding
salad, steak, cake
salad, steak, pudding
We can also find the total number of possible dinners by multiplying.
We could also conclude that there are 12 possible dinner choices simply by applying the Multiplication Principle.
 $$

# Finding the Number of Permutations of *n* Distinct Objects
The Multiplication Principle can be used to solve a variety of problem types. One type of problem involves placing objects in order. We arrange letters into words and digits into numbers, line up for photographs, decorate rooms, and more. An ordering of objects is called a **permutation**.

## Finding the Number of Permutations of *n* Distinct Objects Using the Multiplication Principle
To solve permutation problems, it is often helpful to draw line segments for each option. That enables us to determine the number of each option so we can multiply. For instance, suppose we have four paintings, and we want to find the number of ways we can hang three of the paintings in order on the wall. We can draw three lines to represent the three places on the wall.

![Image](../../media/CNX_Precalc_Figure_11_05_005.jpg)

There are four options for the first place, so we write a 4 on the first line.

![Four times two blanks spots.](../../media/CNX_Precalc_Figure_11_05_006.jpg)

After the first place has been filled, there are three options for the second place so we write a 3 on the second line.

![Four times three times one blank spot.](../../media/CNX_Precalc_Figure_11_05_007.jpg)

After the second place has been filled, there are two options for the third place so we write a 2 on the third line. Finally, we find the product.

![Image](../../media/CNX_Precalc_Figure_11_05_008.jpg)

There are 24 possible permutations of the paintings.

## Finding the Number of Permutations of *n* Distinct Objects Using a Formula
For some permutation problems, it is inconvenient to use the Multiplication Principle because there are so many numbers to multiply. Fortunately, we can solve these problems using a formula. Before we learn the formula, let’s look at two common notations for permutations. If we have a set of $n$ objects and we want to choose $r$ objects from the set in order, we write $P(n,r).$ Another way to write this is $n{P}_{r},$ a notation commonly seen on computers and calculators. To calculate $P(n,r),$ we begin by finding $n!,$ the number of ways to line up all $n$ objects. We then divide by $\left(n-r\right)!$ to cancel out the $\left(n-r\right)$ items that we do not wish to line up.
Let’s see how this works with a simple example. Imagine a club of six people. They need to elect a president, a vice president, and a treasurer. Six people can be elected president, any one of the five remaining people can be elected vice president, and any of the remaining four people could be elected treasurer. The number of ways this may be done is $6\times 5\times 4=120.$ Using factorials, we get the same result.
 $$
\frac{6!}{3!}=\frac{6\xb75\xb74\xb73!}{3!}=6\xb75\xb74=120
$$ There are 120 ways to select 3 officers in order from a club with 6 members. We refer to this as a permutation of 6 taken 3 at a time. The general formula is as follows.
 $$
P(n,r)=\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}
$$ Note that the formula stills works if we are choosing *all* $n$ objects and placing them in order. In that case we would be dividing by $\left(n-n\right)!$ or $0!,$ which we said earlier is equal to 1. So the number of permutations of $n$ objects taken $n$ at a time is $\frac{n!}{1}$ or just $n!\text{.}$

# Find the Number of Combinations Using the Formula
So far, we have looked at problems asking us to put objects in order. There are many problems in which we want to select a few objects from a group of objects, but we do not care about the order. When we are selecting objects and the order does not matter, we are dealing with **combinations**. A selection of $r$ objects from a set of $n$ objects where the order does not matter can be written as $C(n,r).$ Just as with permutations, $\text{C}(n,r)$ can also be written as ${\phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}}_{n}{C}_{r}.$ In this case, the general formula is as follows.
 $$
\text{C}(n,r)=\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
$$ An earlier problem considered choosing 3 of 4 possible paintings to hang on a wall. We found that there were 24 ways to select 3 of the 4 paintings in order. But what if we did not care about the order? We would expect a smaller number because selecting paintings 1, 2, 3 would be the same as selecting paintings 2, 3, 1. To find the number of ways to select 3 of the 4 paintings, disregarding the order of the paintings, divide the number of permutations by the number of ways to order 3 paintings. There are $3!=3\xb72\xb71=6$ ways to order 3 paintings. There are $\frac{24}{6},$ or 4 ways to select 3 of the 4 paintings. This number makes sense because every time we are selecting 3 paintings, we are *not* selecting 1 painting. There are 4 paintings we could choose *not* to select, so there are 4 ways to select 3 of the 4 paintings.

# Finding the Number of Subsets of a Set
We have looked only at combination problems in which we chose exactly $r$ objects. In some problems, we want to consider choosing every possible number of objects. Consider, for example, a pizza restaurant that offers 5 toppings. Any number of toppings can be ordered. How many different pizzas are possible?
To answer this question, we need to consider pizzas with any number of toppings. There is $C(5,0)=1$ way to order a pizza with no toppings. There are $C(5,1)=5$ ways to order a pizza with exactly one topping. If we continue this process, we get
 $C(5,0)+C(5,1)+C(5,2)+C(5,3)+C(5,4)+C(5,5)=32$ There are 32 possible pizzas. This result is equal to ${2}^{5}.$ 
We are presented with a sequence of choices. For each of the $n$ objects we have two choices: include it in the subset or not. So for the whole subset we have made $n$ choices, each with two options. So there are a total of $2\xb72\xb72\xb7\dots \xb72$ possible resulting subsets, all the way from the empty subset, which we obtain when we say “no” each time, to the original set itself, which we obtain when we say “yes” each time.

# Finding the Number of Permutations of *n* Non-Distinct Objects
We have studied permutations where all of the objects involved were distinct. What happens if some of the objects are indistinguishable? For example, suppose there is a sheet of 12 stickers. If all of the stickers were distinct, there would be $12!$ ways to order the stickers. However, 4 of the stickers are identical stars, and 3 are identical moons. Because all of the objects are not distinct, many of the $12!$ permutations we counted are duplicates. The general formula for this situation is as follows.
 $$
\frac{n!}{{r}_{1}!{r}_{2}!\dots {r}_{k}!}
$$ In this example, we need to divide by the number of ways to order the 4 stars and the ways to order the 3 moons to find the number of unique permutations of the stickers. There are $4!$ ways to order the stars and $3!$ ways to order the moon.
 $$
\frac{12!}{4!3!}=3\text{,}326\text{,}400
$$
There are 3,326,400 ways to order the sheet of stickers.

# Key Equations

| number of permutations of $n$ distinct objects taken $r$ at a time | $P(n,r)=\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$ |
| :--- | :--- |
| number of combinations of $n$ distinct objects taken $r$ at a time | $C(n,r)=\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$ |

# Key Concepts
If one event can occur in $m$ ways and a second event with no common outcomes can occur in $n$ ways, then the first or second event can occur in $m+n$ ways. See .
If one event can occur in $m$ ways and a second event can occur in $n$ ways after the first event has occurred, then the two events can occur in $m\times n$ ways. See .
A permutation is an ordering of $n$ objects.
If we have a set of $n$ objects and we want to choose $r$ objects from the set in order, we write $P(n,r).$ 
Permutation problems can be solved using the Multiplication Principle or the formula for $P(n,r).$ See  and .
A selection of objects where the order does not matter is a combination.
Given $n$ distinct objects, the number of ways to select $r$ objects from the set is $\text{C}(n,r)$ and can be found using a formula. See .
A set containing $n$ distinct objects has ${2}^{n}$ subsets. See .
For counting problems involving non-distinct objects, we need to divide to avoid counting duplicate permutations. See .

# Section Exercises

## Verbal
For the following exercises, assume that there are $n$ ways an event $A$ can happen, $m$ ways an event $B$ can happen, and that $A\phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}\text{and\}B$ are non-overlapping.
1. Use the Addition Principle of counting to explain how many ways event $A\phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}\text{or\}B$ can occur.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

There are $m+n$ ways for either event $A$ or event $B$ to occur.
</details>

2. Use the Multiplication Principle of counting to explain how many ways event $A\phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}\text{and\}B$ can occur.

Answer the following questions.
3. When given two separate events, how do we know whether to apply the Addition Principle or the Multiplication Principle when calculating possible outcomes? What conjunctions may help to determine which operations to use?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

The addition principle is applied when determining the total possible of outcomes of either event occurring. The multiplication principle is applied when determining the total possible outcomes of both events occurring. The word “or” usually implies an addition problem. The word “and” usually implies a multiplication problem.
