Objective 2: Determine the degree of polynomials (IA 5.1.1).A term can be a number like -2, a variable like x, or a product of numbers and  variables like 7x3 .
A polynomial is an expression with more than one term with no variables in the denominator and no negative exponents. Any exponent on the variables must be whole numbers.For example 2x+1, 4x2-5x+3 are polynomials.There are three particular types of polynomials:A monomial is a one term polynomial like 7x3 or 2.A binomial is a two term polynomial like 7x3+2 .A trinomial is a three term polynomial like 4x2-5x+3 .The degree of a polynomial in one variable is the highest exponent that appears on the variable in the polynomial. For example, the polynomial 5x2+7x-4 has only one variable, x . The highest exponent on x is 2.
Determine the degree of polynomials.
  
If the expression is a polynomial, identify it as a monomial, binomial, trinomial, or other polynomial, and then find the degree of each polynomial. If it is not a polynomial, state this and give a reason why.

Power FunctionsA power function is a function with a single term that is the product of a real number, a coefficient, and a variable raised to a fixed real number.
A power function is a function that can be represented in the form f(x)=kxp where k  and p  are real numbers, and k  is known as the coefficient.

     years after 2009. We can use this model to estimate the maximum bird population and when it will occur. We can also use this model to predict when the bird population will disappear from the island. In this section, we will examine functions that we can use to estimate and predict these types of changes.
    Identifying Power Functions
    Before we can understand the bird problem, it will be helpful to understand a different type of function. A power function is a function with a single term that is the product of a real number, a coefficient, and a variable raised to a fixed real number.    As an example, consider functions for area or volume. The function for the area of a circle with radius 
      
     r
      
    
      is
    
     
      
        A(r)=π
          r
          2
        

      
    
        and the function for the volume of a sphere with radius

      is 
     
 
  V(r)=
   4
   3
  
  π
   r

    Both of these are examples of power functions because they consist of a coefficient, 
 π
 
 or

  π,
 
 multiplied by a variable 
 r
 
 raised to a power.Power Function
A power function is a function that can be represented in the form
       
 
  f(x)=k

where 
 k
 

and 
 p
 
 are real numbers, and 
 k
 

is known as the coefficient.
    Q&A
      Is 
 f(x)=

 a power function?No. A power function contains a variable base raised to a fixed power. This function has a constant base raised to a variable power. This is called an exponential function, not a power function.

  Identifying End Behavior of Power Functions shows the graphs of 
 f(x)=

   2
  
  ,g(x)=
   x
   4
  

 
 and 
 h(x)=
   x
   6
  
  ,
 
 which are all power functions with even, positive integer powers. Notice that these graphs have similar shapes, very much like that of the quadratic function in the toolkit. However, as the power increases, the graphs flatten somewhat near the origin and become steeper away from the origin.

Even-power functionsTo describe the behavior as numbers become larger and larger, we use the idea of infinity. We use the symbol 
 ∞
 
 for positive infinity and 
 −∞
 
 for negative infinity. When we say that “ 
 
  x
 
 approaches infinity,” which can be symbolically written as 
 x→∞,
 
 we are describing a behavior; we are saying that 
 x
 
 is increasing without bound.With the positive even-power function, as the input increases or decreases without bound, the output values become very large, positive numbers. Equivalently, we could describe this behavior by saying that as 
 x
 
 approaches positive or negative infinity, the 
 f(
   x
  )
 
 values increase without bound. In symbolic form, we could write  
 
  as x→±∞, f(x)→∞
 
  shows the graphs of 
 f(x)=
   x

  ,g(x)=
   x
   5
  
  ,
 
 and 
 h(x)=
   x
   7
  
  ,
 
 which are all power functions with odd, whole-number powers. Notice that these graphs look similar to the cubic function in the toolkit. Again, as the power increases, the graphs flatten near the origin and become steeper away from the origin.

Odd-power functionsThese examples illustrate that functions of the form 
 f(
   x
  )=
   x
   n
  

 
 reveal symmetry of one kind or another. First, in  we see that even functions of the form 
 f(
   x
  )=
   x
   n
  
  , n
 
 even, are symmetric about the 
 y-
 
 axis. In  we see that odd functions of the form 
 f(
   x
  )=
   x
   n
  
  , n
 
  odd, are symmetric about the origin.For these odd power functions, as 
 x
 

approaches negative infinity, 
 f(
   x
  )
 

decreases without bound. As 
 x
 

approaches positive infinity, 
 f(
   x
  )
 

increases without bound. In symbolic form we write
 
 
  
   
    as x→−∞, f(x)→−∞ 
   
  
  
   
    as x→∞, f(x)→∞
  
 

The behavior of the graph of a function as the input values get very small ( 
 x→−∞
 
 ) and get very large ( 
 x→∞
 
 ) is referred to as the end behavior of the function. We can use words or symbols to describe end behavior. shows the end behavior of power functions in the form 
 f(x)=k
   x
   n
  

 
 where 
 n
 
 is a non-negative integer depending on the power and the constant.

How To
Given a power function 
 f(x)=k
   x
   n
  

 
 where 
 n
 
 is a positive integer, identify the end behavior.Determine whether the power is even or odd.
Determine whether the constant is positive or negative.
Use  to identify the end behavior.

Identifying the End Behavior of a Power Function
Describe the end behavior of the graph of 
 f(x)=
   x
   8
  
  .
 
 

The coefficient is 1 (positive) and the exponent of the power function is 8 (an even number). As 
 x
 
 approaches infinity, the output (value of 
 f(x)
 
 ) increases without bound. We write as 
 x→∞,f(x)→∞.
 
 As 
 x
 
 approaches negative infinity, the output increases without bound. In symbolic form, as 
 
  x→−∞, f(x)→∞.
 
 We can graphically represent the function as shown in .

Identifying the End Behavior of a Power Function.
Describe the end behavior of the graph of 
 f(x)=−
   x
   9
  
  .
 

The exponent of the power function is 9 (an odd number). Because the coefficient is 
 –1
 
 (negative), the graph is the reflection about the 
 x-
 
 axis of the graph of 
 f(x)=
   x
   9
  
  .
 
  shows that as 
 x
 
 approaches infinity, the output decreases without bound. As 
 x
 
 approaches negative infinity, the output increases without bound. In symbolic form, we would write
 
 
  
   
    as x→−∞, f(x)→∞ 
   
  
  
   
    as x→∞, f(x)→−∞
  
 

Analysis 
We can check our work by using the table feature on a graphing utility.

–1,000,000,000

We can see from  that, when we substitute very small values for 
 x,
 
 the output is very large, and when we substitute very large values for 
 x,
 
 the output is very small (meaning that it is a very large negative value).

As 
 x

 f(

 decreases without bound: as 
 x→±∞, f(x)→−∞
 
 because of the negative coefficient.

Identifying Polynomial Functions
An oil pipeline bursts in the Gulf of Mexico, causing an oil slick in a roughly circular shape. The slick is currently 24 miles in radius, but that radius is increasing by 8 miles each week. We want to write a formula for the area covered by the oil slick by combining two functions. The radius 
 r
 

of the spill depends on the number of weeks 
 w
 

that have passed. This relationship is linear.
 
 
  r(w)=24+8w
 

We can combine this with the formula for the area 
 A
 

of a circle.
 
 
  A(r)=π
   r
   2
  

 

Composing these functions gives a formula for the area in terms of weeks.

 
 
  
   
    
     
      A(w)
    
    =
    
     
      A(r(w))
    
   
   
    
    =
    
     
      A(24+8w)
    
   
   
    
    =
    
     
      π
       
        (24+8w)
       2
      
      
    
   

  

Multiplying gives the formula.
 
 
  A(w)=576π+384πw+64π
   w
   2
  

 

This formula is an example of a polynomial function. A polynomial function consists of either zero or the sum of a finite number of non-zero terms, each of which is a product of a number, called the coefficient of the term, and a variable raised to a non-negative integer power.

Identifying the Degree and Leading Coefficient of a Polynomial Function
Because of the form of a polynomial function, we can see an infinite variety in the number of terms and the power of the variable. Although the order of the terms in the polynomial function is not important for performing operations, we typically arrange the terms in descending order of power, or in general form. The degree of the polynomial is the highest power of the variable that occurs in the polynomial; it is the power of the first variable if the function is in general form. The leading term is the term containing the highest power of the variable, or the term with the highest degree. The leading coefficient is the coefficient of the leading term.

Terminology of Polynomial Functions

We often rearrange polynomials so that the powers are descending.

When a polynomial is written in this way, we say that it is in general form.

Given a polynomial function, identify the degree and leading coefficient.

Identifying End Behavior of Polynomial FunctionsKnowing the degree of a polynomial function is useful in helping us predict its end behavior. To determine its end behavior, look at the leading term of the polynomial function. Because the power of the leading term is the highest, that term will grow significantly faster than the other terms as 
 x
 

gets very large or very small, so its behavior will dominate the graph. For any polynomial, the end behavior of the polynomial will match the end behavior of the power function consisting of the leading term. See .

Identifying End Behavior and Degree of a Polynomial Function
Describe the end behavior and determine a possible degree of the polynomial function in .

As the input values 
 x
 

get very large, the output values 
 f(x)
 
 increase without bound. As the input values 
 x
 

get very small, the output values 
 f(x)
 
 decrease without bound. We can describe the end behavior symbolically by writing 
 
 
  
   
    as x→−∞, f(x)→−∞ 
   
  
  
   
    as x→∞, f(x)→∞
   
  
 

In words, we could say that as 
 x
 
 values approach infinity, the function values approach infinity, and as 
 x
 
 values approach negative infinity, the function values approach negative infinity.We can tell this graph has the shape of an odd degree power function that has not been reflected, so the degree of the polynomial creating this graph must be odd and the leading coefficient must be positive.

Identifying End Behavior and Degree of a Polynomial Function
Given the function 
 f(x)=−3
   x
   2
  
  (x−1)(x+4),
 
 express the function as a polynomial in general form, and determine the leading term, degree, and end behavior of the function.

Obtain the general form by expanding the given expression for 
 f(
   x
  ).
 

 
 
  
   
    
     
      f(x)
    
    
     =
    
    
     
      −3
       x

      (

        +3x−4
      )

  )=−3
   x

The leading term is

   x
   4
  
  ;
 

therefore, the degree of the polynomial is 4. The degree is even (4) and the leading coefficient is negative (–3), so the end behavior is 
 
  
   
    as x→−∞, f(x)→−∞ 
   
  
  
   
    as x→∞, f(x)→−∞
   
  
 

Try It

Given the function 
 f(x)=0.2(x−2)(x+1)(x−5),
 
 express the function as a polynomial in general form and determine the leading term, degree, and end behavior of the function. 
The leading term is 
 0.2
   x
   3
  
  ,
 
 so it is a degree 3 polynomial. As 
 x
 
 approaches positive infinity, 
 f(
   x
  )
 
 increases without bound; as 
 x
 
 approaches negative infinity, 
 f(
   x
  )
 
 decreases without bound. 

Identifying Local Behavior of Polynomial Functions
In addition to the end behavior of polynomial functions, we are also interested in what happens in the “middle” of the function. In particular, we are interested in locations where graph behavior changes. A turning point is a point at which the function values change from increasing to decreasing or decreasing to increasing.
We are also interested in the intercepts. As with all functions, the y-intercept is the point at which the graph intersects the vertical axis. The point corresponds to the coordinate pair in which the input value is zero. Because a polynomial is a function, only one output value corresponds to each input value so there can be only one y-intercept 
 (0,
   a
   0
  
  ).
 
 The x-intercepts occur at the input values that correspond to an output value of zero. It is possible to have more than one x-intercept. See .

Intercepts and Turning Points of Polynomial Functions
A turning point of a graph is a point at which the graph changes direction from increasing to decreasing or decreasing to increasing. The y-intercept is the point at which the function has an input value of zero. The x-intercepts are the points at which the output value is zero.

How To
Given a polynomial function, determine the intercepts.
Determine the y-intercept by setting 
 x=0
 
 and finding the corresponding output value.
Determine the x-intercepts by solving for the input values that yield an output value of zero.

Determining the Intercepts of a Polynomial Function
Given the polynomial function 
 f(x)=(x−2)(x+1)(x−4),
 
 written in factored form for your convenience, determine the y- and x-intercepts.

The y-intercept occurs when the input is zero so substitute 0 for 
 x.
 

 
 
  
   
    
     
      f(0)
    
    =
    
     f(0)=(0-2)(0+1)(0-4)

    
   
   
    
    =
    
     (-2)(1)(-4)
    
   
   
    
    =
    
     8
    
   
  

The y-intercept is (0, 8).
The x-intercepts occur when the output is zero.

Comparing Smooth and Continuous Graphs
The degree of a polynomial function helps us to determine the number of x-intercepts and the number of turning points. A polynomial function of 
 nth
 
 degree is the product of 
 n
 
 factors, so it will have at most 
 n
 
 roots or zeros, or x-intercepts. The graph of the polynomial function of degree 
 n
 
 must have at most 
 n–1
 
 turning points. This means the graph has at most one fewer turning point than the degree of the polynomial or one fewer than the number of factors.A continuous function has no breaks in its graph: the graph can be drawn without lifting the pen from the paper. A smooth curve is a graph that has no sharp corners. The turning points of a smooth graph must always occur at rounded curves. The graphs of polynomial functions are both continuous and smooth.

 n
 
 will have, at most,

Drawing Conclusions about a Polynomial Function from the Graph
What can we conclude about the polynomial represented by the graph shown in  based on its intercepts and turning points?

The end behavior of the graph tells us this is the graph of an even-degree polynomial. See .

The graph has 2 x-intercepts, suggesting a degree of 2 or greater, and 3 turning points, suggesting a degree of 4 or greater. Based on this, it would be reasonable to conclude that the degree is even and at least 4.

Try It

What can we conclude about the polynomial represented by the graph shown in  based on its intercepts and turning points?

The end behavior indicates an odd-degree polynomial function; there are 3

Key Concepts
A power function is a variable base raised to a number power. See .
The behavior of a graph as the input decreases beyond bound and increases beyond bound is called the end behavior.
The end behavior depends on whether the power is even or odd. See  and .
A polynomial function is the sum of terms, each of which consists of a transformed power function with positive whole number power. See .
The degree of a polynomial function is the highest power of the variable that occurs in a polynomial. The term containing the highest power of the variable is called the leading term. The coefficient of the leading term is called the leading coefficient. See .
The end behavior of a polynomial function is the same as the end behavior of the power function represented by the leading term of the function. See  and .

The coefficient of the power function is the real number that is multiplied by the variable raised to a power. The degree is the highest power appearing in the function.
If a polynomial function is in factored form, what would be a good first step in order to determine the degree of the function?
In general, explain the end behavior of a power function with odd degree if the leading coefficient is positive.
