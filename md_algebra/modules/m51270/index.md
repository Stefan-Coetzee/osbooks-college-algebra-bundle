Objective 1: Find the slope of a line. (IA 3.2.1)Linear functions are a specific type of function that can be used to model many real-world applications, such as the growth of a plant, earned salary, the distance a train travels over time, or the costs to start a new business. In this section, we will explore linear functions, their graphs, and how to find them using data points.Linear FunctionA linear function is a function whose graph is a line. Linear functions can be written in the slope-intercept form of a line f(x)=mx+b where b is the initial or starting value of the function (when input, x=0), and m is the constant rate of change, or slope of the function.

  Shanghai MagLev Train (credit: "kanegen"/Flickr)Just as with the growth of a bamboo plant, there are many situations that involve constant change over time. Consider, for example, the first commercial maglev train in the world, the Shanghai MagLev Train (). It carries passengers comfortably for a 30-kilometer trip from the airport to the subway station in only eight minuteshttp://www.chinahighlights.com/shanghai/transportation/maglev-train.htm. 
  Suppose a maglev train travels a long distance, and maintains a constant speed of 83 meters per second for a period of time once it is 250 meters from the station. How can we analyze the train’s distance from the station as a function of time? In this section, we will investigate a kind of function that is useful for this purpose, and use it to investigate real-world situations such as the train’s distance from the station at a given point in time.

  
    Representing Linear Functions
    The function describing the train’s motion is a linear function, which is defined as a function with a constant rate of change. This is a polynomial of degree 1. There are several ways to represent a linear function, including word form, function notation, tabular form, and graphical form. We will describe the train’s motion as a function using each method.
    
      Representing a Linear Function in Word Form
      Let’s begin by describing the linear function in words. For the train problem we just considered, the following word sentence may be used to describe the function relationship.
      
        The train’s distance from the station is a function of the time during which the train moves at a constant speed plus its original distance from the station when it began moving at constant speed.
      

      The speed is the rate of change. Recall that a rate of change is a measure of how quickly the dependent variable changes with respect to the independent variable. The rate of change for this example is constant, which means that it is the same for each input value. As the time (input) increases by 1 second, the corresponding distance (output) increases by 83 meters. The train began moving at this constant speed at a distance of 250 meters from the station.
    
    
      Representing a Linear Function in Function Notation
      Another approach to representing linear functions is by using function notation. One example of function notation is an equation written in the slope-intercept form of a line, where 
        
          x
        
       is the input value, 
        
          m
        
       is the rate of change, and 
        
          b
        
       is the initial value of the dependent variable.
      
 
 
  
   
    
     
      Equation form
      
     
    
    
     
      y=mx+b
     
    
   
   
    
     
      Function notation
      
     
    
    
     
      f(x)=mx+b
     
    
   

  
 

In the example of the train, we might use the notation 
        
          D(t)
        
       where the total distance 
        
          D
        
       is a function of the time 
 
t.
 
 The rate, 
        
          m,
        
       is 83 meters per second. The initial value of the dependent variable 
        
          b
        
       is the original distance from the station, 250 meters. We can write a generalized equation to represent the motion of the train. 
        
          D(t)=83t+250
        
      
      
    
    
      Representing a Linear Function in Tabular Form
      A third method of representing a linear function is through the use of a table. The relationship between the distance from the station and the time is represented in . From the table, we can see that the distance changes by 83 meters for every 1 second increase in time.
      
        
          
        
Tabular representation of the function 
 
D
 
 showing selected input and output values
      
      
        Q&A
        Can the input in the previous example be any real number?
        No. The input represents time so while nonnegative rational and irrational numbers are possible, negative real numbers are not possible for this example. The input consists of non-negative real numbers.
      

    
    
      Representing a Linear Function in Graphical Form
      Another way to represent linear functions is visually, using a graph. We can use the function relationship from above, 
 
D(t)=83t+250,
 
 to draw a graph as represented in . Notice the graph is a line. When we plot a linear function, the graph is always a line.
      The rate of change, which is constant, determines the slant, or slope of the line. The point at which the input value is zero is the vertical intercept, or y-intercept, of the line. We can see from the graph that the y-intercept in the train example we just saw is 
 
(0,250)
 
 and represents the distance of the train from the station when it began moving at a constant speed.
      
        
          
        
The graph of 
 
D(t)=83t+250
 
 . Graphs of linear functions are lines because the rate of change is constant.

      
      Notice that the graph of the train example is restricted, but this is not always the case. Consider the graph of the line 
 
f(x)=2x+1.
 

Ask yourself what numbers can be input to the function. In other words, what is the domain of the function? The domain is comprised of all real numbers because any number may be doubled, and then have one added to the product.Linear Function

        A linear function is a function whose graph is a line. Linear functions can be written in the slope-intercept form of a line
         
 
  f(x)=mx+b
 
 
        where 
 
b
 
 is the initial or starting value of the function (when input, 
 
x=0
 
 ), and 
 
m
 
 is the constant rate of change, or slope of the function. The y-intercept is at 
 
(0,b).
 

      
        
          
            Using a Linear Function to Find the Pressure on a Diver
            The pressure, 
 
P,
 
 in pounds per square inch (PSI) on the diver in  depends upon her depth below the water surface, 
 
d,
 
 in feet. This relationship may be modeled by the equation, 
 
P(d)=0.434d+14.696.
 
 Restate this function in words.
              
                
              
(credit: Ilse Reijs and Jan-Noud Hutten)
            
          
          
            To restate the function in words, we need to describe each part of the equation. The pressure as a function of depth equals four hundred thirty-four thousandths times depth plus fourteen and six hundred ninety-six thousandths.
          
          
            Analysis
            The initial value, 14.696, is the pressure in PSI on the diver at a depth of 0 feet, which is the surface of the water. The rate of change, or slope, is 0.434 PSI per foot. This tells us that the pressure on the diver increases 0.434 PSI for each foot her depth increases.
            
        
      
  

Determining Whether a Linear Function Is Increasing, Decreasing, or Constant
The linear functions we used in the two previous examples increased over time, but not every linear function does. A linear function may be increasing, decreasing, or constant. For an increasing function, as with the train example, the output values increase as the input values increase. The graph of an increasing function has a positive slope. A line with a positive slope slants upward from left to right as in (a). For a decreasing function, the slope is negative. The output values decrease as the input values increase. A line with a negative slope slants downward from left to right as in (b). If the function is constant, the output values are the same for all input values so the slope is zero. A line with a slope of zero is horizontal as in (c).

Increasing and Decreasing Functions

The slope determines if the function is an increasing linear function, a decreasing linear function, or a constant function.

 
 
  f(x)=mx+b
 
 is an increasing function if 
 
m>0.
 
 
 
 
  f(x)=mx+b
 
 is a decreasing function if 
 
m<0.
 

 
 
  f(x)=mx+b
 
 is a constant function if 
 
m=0.
 

Deciding Whether a Function Is Increasing, Decreasing, or Constant 
Studies from the early 2010s indicated that teens sent about 60 texts a day, while more recent data indicates much higher messaging rates among all users, particularly considering the various apps with which people can communicate.http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-501465_162-57400228-501465/teens-are-sending-60-texts-a-day-study-says/. For each of the following scenarios, find the linear function that describes the relationship between the input value and the output value. Then, determine whether the graph of the function is increasing, decreasing, or constant.

ⓐThe total number of texts a teen sends is considered a function of time in days. The input is the number of days, and output is the total number of texts sent.
ⓑA person has a limit of 500 texts per month in their data plan. The input is the number of days, and output is the total number of texts remaining for the month.
ⓒA person has an unlimited number of texts in their data plan for a cost of $50 per month. The input is the number of days, and output is the total cost of texting each month.

Analyze each function.

ⓐThe function can be represented as 
 
f(x)=60x
 
 where 
 
x
 
 is the number of days. The slope, 60, is positive so the function is increasing. This makes sense because the total number of texts increases with each day.
ⓑThe function can be represented as 
 
f(x)=500−60x
 
 where 
 
x
 
 is the number of days. In this case, the slope is negative so the function is decreasing. This makes sense because the number of texts remaining decreases each day and this function represents the number of texts remaining in the data plan after 
 
x
 
 days.
ⓒThe cost function can be represented as 
 
f(x)=50
 
 because the number of days does not affect the total cost. The slope is 0 so the function is constant.

Interpreting Slope as a Rate of Change
In the examples we have seen so far, the slope was provided to us. However, we often need to calculate the slope given input and output values. Recall that given two values for the input, 
 

   x
   1
  

 
 and 
 

   x
   2
  
  ,
 
 and two corresponding values for the output,

 and

     y

  ),
 
 is calculated. Recall that the slope measures steepness, or slant. The greater the absolute value of the slope, the steeper the slant is.

The slope of a function is calculated by the change in 
 
y
 
 divided by the change in 
 
x.
 
 It does not matter which coordinate is used as the

 as long as each calculation is started with the elements from the same coordinate pair.
Q&A
Are the units for slope always 
 

   
    units for the output
   
   
    units for the input
   
  
  ?
 
 Yes. Think of the units as the change of output value for each unit of change in input value. An example of slope could be miles per hour or dollars per day. Notice the units appear as a ratio of units for the output per units for the input.

Calculate Slope
The slope, or rate of change, of a function

Finding the Slope of a Linear Function
If 
 
f(x)
 
 is a linear function, and 
 
(3,−2)
 
 and 
 
(8,1)
 
 are points on the line, find the slope. Is this function increasing or decreasing?

The coordinate pairs are 
 
(3,−2)
 
 and 
 
(8,1).
 
 To find the rate of change, we divide the change in output by the change in input. 
 
  m=
   
    change in output
   
   
    change in input
   
  
  =
   
    1−(−2)

  =

   5
  
 

We could also write the slope as 
 
m=0.6.
 
 The function is increasing because 
 
m>0.
 
 

Analysis
As noted earlier, the order in which we write the points does not matter when we compute the slope of the line as long as the first output value, or y-coordinate, used corresponds with the first input value, or x-coordinate, used. Note that if we had reversed them, we would have obtained the same slope.

Finding the Population Change from a Linear Function
The population of a city increased from 23,400 to 27,800 between 2008 and 2012. Find the change of population per year if we assume the change was constant from 2008 to 2012.

The rate of change relates the change in population to the change in time. The population increased by 
 27,800−23,400=4400
 
 people over the four-year time interval. To find the rate of change, divide the change in the number of people by the number of years.
 
 
  
   
    4,400 people
   
   
    4 years
   
  
  =1,100 
   
    people
   
   
    year
   
  

 

So the population increased by 1,100 people per year.

Analysis
Because we are told that the population increased, we would expect the slope to be positive. This positive slope we calculated is therefore reasonable.

Try It

The population of a small town increased from 1,442 to 1,868 between 2009 and 2012. Find the change of population per year if we assume the change was constant from 2009 to 2012.

 
 
  m=
   
    1,868−1,442
   
   
    2,012−2,009
   
  
  =
   
    426

  =142 people per year
 

Writing and Interpreting an Equation for a Linear FunctionRecall from Equations and Inequalities that we wrote equations in both the slope-intercept form and the point-slope form. Now we can choose which method to use to write equations for linear functions based on the information we are given. That information may be provided in the form of a graph, a point and a slope, two points, and so on. Look at the graph of the function 
 
f
 
 in .

We are not given the slope of the line, but we can choose any two points on the line to find the slope. Let’s choose

Now we can substitute the slope and the coordinates of one of the points into the point-slope form.

     =

       3
       4
      
      (x−4)
     
    
   

  
 

If we want to rewrite the equation in the slope-intercept form, we would find
 
 
  
   
    
     
      y−4
     
    
    
     =
    
    
     
      −
       3
       4
      
      (x−4)

     =
    
    
     
      −
       3
       4

     y
    
    
     =
    
    
     
      −
       3
       4
      
      x+7
     
    
   

  
 

If we want to find the slope-intercept form without first writing the point-slope form, we could have recognized that the line crosses the y-axis when the output value is 7. Therefore, 
 
b=7.
 
 We now have the initial value 
 
b
 
 and the slope 
 
m
 
 so we can substitute 
 
m
 
 and 
 
b
 
 into the slope-intercept form of a line.

So the function is 
 
  f(x)=−
   3
   4
  
  x+7,
 
 and the linear equation would be 
 
y=−
   3
   4
  
  x+7.

Writing an Equation for a Linear Cost Function 
Suppose Ben starts a company in which he incurs a fixed cost of $1,250 per month for the overhead, which includes his office rent. His production costs are $37.50 per item. Write a linear function 
 
C
 
 where 
 
C(
   x
  )
 
 is the cost for 
 
x
 
 items produced in a given month.

The fixed cost is present every month, $1,250. The costs that can vary include the cost to produce each item, which is $37.50. The variable cost, called the marginal cost, is represented by 
 
37.5.
 
 The cost Ben incurs is the sum of these two costs, represented by 
 
C(
   x
  )=1250+37.5x.
 
 

Analysis
If Ben produces 100 items in a month, his monthly cost is found by substituting 100 for 
 
x.
 

 
 
  
   
    
     
      C(100)
     
    
    
     =
    
    
     
      1250+37.5(100)
     
    
   
   
    
    
     =
    
    
     
      5000
     
    
   

  
 

So his monthly cost would be $5,000.

Writing an Equation for a Linear Function Given Two Points

f(8)=1,
 
 find an equation for the function in slope-intercept form.

We can write the given points using coordinates.
 
 
  
   
    
     
      f(3)
     
    
    
     =

Modeling Real-World Problems with Linear Functions
In the real world, problems are not always explicitly stated in terms of a function or represented with a graph. Fortunately, we can analyze the problem by first representing it as a linear function and then interpreting the components of the function. As long as we know, or can figure out, the initial value and the rate of change of a linear function, we can solve many different kinds of real-world problems.

How To
Given a linear function 
 
f
 
 and the initial value and rate of change, evaluate 
 
f(
   c
  ).
 

Determine the initial value and the rate of change (slope).
Substitute the values into 
 
f(x)=mx+b.
 

Evaluate the function at 
 
x=c.
 

Using a Linear Function to Determine the Number of Songs in a Music Collection
Marcus currently has 200 songs in his music collection. Every month, he adds 15 new songs. Write a formula for the number of songs, 
 
N,
 
 in his collection as a function of time, 
 
t,
 
 the number of months. How many songs will he own at the end of one year?

The initial value for this function is 200 because he currently owns 200 songs, so 
 
N(0)=200,
 
 which means that 
 
b=200.
 
 The number of songs increases by 15 songs per month, so the rate of change is 15 songs per month. Therefore we know that 
 
m=15.
 
 We can substitute the initial value and the rate of change into the slope-intercept form of a line.

We can write the formula 
 
N(t)=15t+200.
 

With this formula, we can then predict how many songs Marcus will have at the end of one year (12 months). In other words, we can evaluate the function at 
 
t=12.
 
 
 
 
  
   
    
     
      N(12)
     
    
    
     =
    
    
     
      15(12)+200
     
    
   
   
    
    
     =
    
    
     
      180+200
     
    
   
   
    
    
     =
    
    
     
      380
     
    
   

  
 

Marcus will have 380 songs in 12 months.

Analysis 
Notice that N is an increasing linear function. As the input (the number of months) increases, the output (number of songs) increases as well.

Using a Linear Function to Calculate Salary Based on Commission
Working as an insurance salesperson, Ilya earns a base salary plus a commission on each new policy. Therefore, Ilya’s weekly income 
 
I,
 
 depends on the number of new policies, 
 
n,
 
 he sells during the week. Last week he sold 3 new policies, and earned $760 for the week. The week before, he sold 5 new policies and earned $920. Find an equation for 
 
I(n),
 
 and interpret the meaning of the components of the equation.

The given information gives us two input-output pairs: 
 
(3,760)
 
 and 
 
(5,920).
 
 We start by finding the rate of change. 
 
  
   
    
     m
    
    
     =
    
    
     
      
       
        920−760
       
       
        5−3
       
      

     
    
   
   
    
    
     =
    
    
     
      
       
        $160
       
       
        2 policies
       
      

     
    
   
   
    
    
     =
    
    
     
      $80perpolicy
     
    
   

  
 

Keeping track of units can help us interpret this quantity. Income increased by $160 when the number of policies increased by 2, so the rate of change is $80 per policy. Therefore, Ilya earns a commission of $80 for each policy sold during the week.
We can then solve for the initial value.
 

 

I(n)

 
=

 

80n+b

 

 
  

760

  
=

  

80(3)+b

  
   
 whenn=3,I(3)=760

 
  

760

  
−

  

80(3)=b

  

 
  

520

  
=

  
b

  

The value of 
 
b
 
 is the starting value for the function and represents Ilya’s income when 
 
n=0,
 
 or when no new policies are sold. We can interpret this as Ilya’s base salary for the week, which does not depend upon the number of policies sold.
We can now write the final equation.
 
 
  I(n)=80n+520
 

Our final interpretation is that Ilya’s base salary is $520 per week and he earns an additional $80 commission for each policy sold.

Using Tabular Form to Write an Equation for a Linear Function
  relates the number of rats in a population to time, in weeks. Use the table to write a linear equation.

  
  
  
  
  
   
    number of weeks, w
    0
    2
    4
    6
   

   
    number of rats, P(w)
    1000
    1080
    1160
    1240
   
  

We can see from the table that the initial value for the number of rats is 1000, so 
 
b=1000.
 
 
Rather than solving for 
 
m,
 
 we can tell from looking at the table that the population increases by 80 for every 2 weeks that pass. This means that the rate of change is 80 rats per 2 weeks, which can be simplified to 40 rats per week. 
 
  P(w)=40w+1000
 

If we did not notice the rate of change from the table we could still solve for the slope using any two points from the table. For example, using 
 
(2,1080)
 
 and 
 
(6,1240)
 

 
 
  
   
    
     m
    
    
     =
    
    
     
      
       
        1240−1080

     =

       4
      

     
    
   
   
    
    
     =
    
    
     
      40
     
    
   

  
 

Q&A
Is the initial value always provided in a table of values like ?No. Sometimes the initial value is provided in a table of values, but sometimes it is not. If you see an input of 0, then the initial value would be the corresponding output. If the initial value is not provided because there is no value of input on the table equal to 0, find the slope, substitute one coordinate pair and the slope into 
 
f(x)=mx+b,
 
 and solve for 
 
b.

Graphing Linear Functions
Now that we’ve seen and interpreted graphs of linear functions, let’s take a look at how to create the graphs. There are three basic methods of graphing linear functions. The first is by plotting points and then drawing a line through the points. The second is by using the y-intercept and slope. And the third method is by using transformations of the identity function 
 
f(x)=x.
 

Graphing a Function by Plotting Points
To find points of a function, we can choose input values, evaluate the function at these input values, and calculate output values. The input values and corresponding output values form coordinate pairs. We then plot the coordinate pairs on a grid. In general, we should evaluate the function at a minimum of two inputs in order to find at least two points on the graph. For example, given the function, 
 
f(x)=2x,
 
 we might use the input values 1 and 2. Evaluating the function for an input value of 1 yields an output value of 2, which is represented by the point 
 
(1,2).
 
 Evaluating the function for an input value of 2 yields an output value of 4, which is represented by the point 
 
(2,4).
 
 Choosing three points is often advisable because if all three points do not fall on the same line, we know we made an error.
How To

Choose a minimum of two input values.
Evaluate the function at each input value.

Evaluate the function at each input value, and use the output value to identify coordinate pairs.

Analysis
The graph of the function is a line as expected for a linear function. In addition, the graph has a downward slant, which indicates a negative slope. This is also expected from the negative, constant rate of change in the equation for the function.

Graphing a Function Using y-intercept and Slope
Another way to graph linear functions is by using specific characteristics of the function rather than plotting points. The first characteristic is its y-intercept, which is the point at which the input value is zero. To find the y-intercept, we can set 
 
x=0
 
 in the equation.
The other characteristic of the linear function is its slope.
Let’s consider the following function.
 
 
  f(x)=
   1
   2
  
  x+1
 

The slope is 
 

   1
   2
  
  .
 
 Because the slope is positive, we know the graph will slant upward from left to right. The y-intercept is the point on the graph when 
 
x=0.
 
 The graph crosses the y-axis at 
 
(0,1).
 
 Now we know the slope and the y-intercept. We can begin graphing by plotting the point 
 
(0,1).
 
 We know that the slope is the change in the y-coordinate over the change in the x-coordinate. This is commonly referred to as rise over run, 
 
m=
   
    rise
   
   
    run
   
  
  .
 
 From our example, we have 
 
m=
   1
   2
  
  ,
 
 which means that the rise is 1 and the run is 2. So starting from our y-intercept 
 
(0,1),
 
 we can rise 1 and then run 2, or run 2 and then rise 1. We repeat until we have a few points, and then we draw a line through the points as shown in .

Graphical Interpretation of a Linear Function

In the equation 
 
f(x)=mx+b
 

 
 
  b
 
 is the y-intercept of the graph and indicates the point 
 
(0,b)
 
 at which the graph crosses the y-axis.
 
 
  m
 
 is the slope of the line and indicates the vertical displacement (rise) and horizontal displacement (run) between each successive pair of points. Recall the formula for the slope:
 
 
  m=

Q&A
Do all linear functions have y-intercepts?
Yes. All linear functions cross the y-axis and therefore have y-intercepts. (Note: A vertical line is parallel to the y-axis does not have a y-intercept, but it is not a function.)

How To
Given the equation for a linear function, graph the function using the y-intercept and slope.
Evaluate the function at an input value of zero to find the y-intercept.
Identify the slope as the rate of change of the input value.
Plot the point represented by the y-intercept.

 using the y-intercept and slope.

Evaluate the function at 
 
x=0
 
 to find the y-intercept. The output value when 
 
x=0
 
 is 5, so the graph will cross the y-axis at 
 
(0,5).
 

According to the equation for the function, the slope of the line is 
 
−
   2
   3
  
  .
 
 This tells us that for each vertical decrease in the “rise” of 
 
–2
 
 units, the “run” increases by 3 units in the horizontal direction. We can now graph the function by first plotting the y-intercept on the graph in . From the initial value 
 
(0,5)
 
 we move down 2 units and to the right 3 units. We can extend the line to the left and right by repeating, and then drawing a line through the points.

Graph of f(x)=−2/3x+5 and shows how to calculate the rise over run for the slope.

Analysis
The graph slants downward from left to right, which means it has a negative slope as expected.

Graphing a Function Using Transformations
Another option for graphing is to use a transformation of the identity function 
 
f(x)=x.
 
 A function may be transformed by a shift up, down, left, or right. A function may also be transformed using a reflection, stretch, or compression.

Vertical Stretch or Compression
In the equation 
 
f(x)=mx,
 
 the 
 
m
 
 is acting as the vertical stretch or compression of the identity function. When 
 
m
 
 is negative, there is also a vertical reflection of the graph.  Notice in  that multiplying the equation of 
 
f(x)=x
 
 by 
 
m
 
 stretches the graph of 
 
f
 
 by a factor of 
 
m
 
 units if 
 
m>1
 
 and compresses the graph of 
 
f
 
 by a factor of 
 
m
 
 units if 
 
0<m<1.
 
 This means the larger the absolute value of 
 
m,
 
 the steeper the slope.

Vertical stretches and compressions and reflections on the function 
 
f(x)=x
 

Vertical Shift
In 
 
f(x)=mx+b,
 
 the 
 
b
 
 acts as the vertical shift, moving the graph up and down without affecting the slope of the line. Notice in  that adding a value of 
 
b
 
 to the equation of 
 
f(
   x
  )=x
 
 shifts the graph of 
 
f
 
 a total of 
 
b
 
 units up if 
 
b
 
 is positive and 
 
|b|
 
 units down if 
 
b
 
 is negative.

This graph illustrates vertical shifts of the function 
 
  f(x)=x.
 
 

Using vertical stretches or compressions along with vertical shifts is another way to look at identifying different types of linear functions. Although this may not be the easiest way to graph this type of function, it is still important to practice each method.

How To
Given the equation of a linear function, use transformations to graph the linear function in the form 
 
f(
   x
  )=mx+b.
 
 

Graph

   x

   2

m=
   1

 so the identity function is vertically compressed by 
 

   1
   2
  
  .
 
 The equation for the function also shows that 
 
b=−3
 
 so the identity function is vertically shifted down 3 units. First, graph the identity function, and show the vertical compression as in .

Q&A
In , could we have sketched the graph by reversing the order of the transformations?
No. The order of the transformations follows the order of operations. When the function is evaluated at a given input, the corresponding output is calculated by following the order of operations. This is why we performed the compression first. For example, following the order: Let the input be 2.

Writing the Equation for a Function from the Graph of a Line
Earlier, we wrote the equation for a linear function from a graph. Now we can extend what we know about graphing linear functions to analyze graphs a little more closely. Begin by taking a look at . We can see right away that the graph crosses the y-axis at the point 
 
(0,4)
 
 so this is the y-intercept.

Then we can calculate the slope by finding the rise and run. We can choose any two points, but let’s look at the point 
 
(–2,0).
 
 To get from this point to the y-intercept, we must move up 4 units (rise) and to the right 2 units (run). So the slope must be 
 
  m=
   
    rise
   
   
    run
   
  
  =
   4
   2
  
  =2
 

Substituting the slope and y-intercept into the slope-intercept form of a line gives
 
 
  y=2x+4
 

How To
Given a graph of linear function, find the equation to describe the function.

Identify the y-intercept of an equation.
Choose two points to determine the slope.
Substitute the y-intercept and slope into the slope-intercept form of a line.

Matching Linear Functions to Their Graphs
Match each equation of the linear functions with one of the lines in .

ⓐ f(x)=2x+3 
ⓑ g(x)=2x−3 
ⓒ h(x)=−2x+3 
ⓓ j(x)=12x+3 

 

Analyze the information for each function.

  ⓐThis function has a slope of 2 and a y-intercept of 3. It must pass through the point (0, 3) and slant upward from left to right. We can use two points to find the slope, or we can compare it with the other functions listed. Function 
 
g
 
 has the same slope, but a different y-intercept. Lines I and III have the same slant because they have the same slope. Line III does not pass through 
 
(0,3)
 
 so 
 
f
 
 must be represented by line I.
ⓑThis function also has a slope of 2, but a y-intercept of 
 
−3.
 
 It must pass through the point 
 
(
   
    0,−3
   
  )
 
 and slant upward from left to right. It must be represented by line III.
ⓒThis function has a slope of –2 and a y-intercept of 3. This is the only function listed with a negative slope, so it must be represented by line IV because it slants downward from left to right.
 ⓓThis function has a slope of 
 

   1
   2
  

 
 and a y-intercept of 3. It must pass through the point (0, 3) and slant upward from left to right. Lines I and II pass through 
 
(0,3),
 
 but the slope of 
 
j
 
 is less than the slope of 
 
f
 
 so the line for 
 
j
 
 must be flatter. This function is represented by Line II.
Now we can re-label the lines as in .

Finding the x-intercept of a Line
So far we have been finding the y-intercepts of a function: the point at which the graph of the function crosses the y-axis. Recall that a function may also have an x-intercept, which is the x-coordinate of the point where the graph of the function crosses the x-axis. In other words, it is the input value when the output value is zero.
To find the x-intercept, set a function 
 
f(x)
 
 equal to zero and solve for the value of 
 
x.
 
 For example, consider the function shown.
 
 
  f(x)=3x−6
 

Set the function equal to 0 and solve for 
 
x.
 
 
 
 
  
   
    
     0
    
    
     =

     =

     x
    
    
     =
    
    
     2
    
   

  
 

The graph of the function crosses the x-axis at the point 
 
(2,0).
 

Q&A
Do all linear functions have x-intercepts?
No. However, linear functions of the form 
 
y=c,
 
 where 
 
c
 
 is a nonzero real number are the only examples of linear functions with no x-intercept. For example, 
 
y=5
 
 is a horizontal line 5 units above the x-axis. This function has no x-intercepts, as shown in .

x-intercept
The x-intercept of the function is value of 
 
x
 
 when 
 
f(x)=0.
 
 It can be solved by the equation 
 
0=mx+b.

Describing Horizontal and Vertical Lines
There are two special cases of lines on a graph—horizontal and vertical lines. A horizontal line indicates a constant output, or y-value. In , we see that the output has a value of 2 for every input value. The change in outputs between any two points, therefore, is 0. In the slope formula, the numerator is 0, so the slope is 0. If we use 
 
m=0
 
 in the equation 
 
f(x)=mx+b,
 
 the equation simplifies to 
 
f(x)=b.
 
 In other words, the value of the function is a constant. This graph represents the function 
 
f(x)=2.
 

A horizontal line representing the function 
 
f(x)=2
 

A vertical line indicates a constant input, or x-value. We can see that the input value for every point on the line is 2, but the output value varies. Because this input value is mapped to more than one output value, a vertical line does not represent a function. Notice that between any two points, the change in the input values is zero. In the slope formula, the denominator will be zero, so the slope of a vertical line is undefined.

Example of how a line has a vertical slope.  0 in the denominator of the slope.A vertical line, such as the one in , has an x-intercept, but no y-intercept unless it’s the line 
 
x=0.

Horizontal and Vertical Lines
Lines can be horizontal or vertical.
A horizontal line is a line defined by an equation in the form 
 
f(x)=b.
 

A vertical line is a line defined by an equation in the form 
 
x=a.
 

Writing the Equation of a Horizontal Line
Write the equation of the line graphed in .

For any x-value, the y-value is 
 
−4,
 
 so the equation is 
 
y=−4.
 
 

Writing the Equation of a Vertical Line
Write the equation of the line graphed in .

The constant x-value is 
 
7,
 
 so the equation is 
 
x=7.
 

Determining Whether Lines are Parallel or Perpendicular
The two lines in  are parallel lines: they will never intersect. They have exactly the same steepness, which means their slopes are identical. The only difference between the two lines is the y-intercept. If we shifted one line vertically toward the other, they would become coincident.

Parallel linesWe can determine from their equations whether two lines are parallel by comparing their slopes. If the slopes are the same and the y-intercepts are different, the lines are parallel. If the slopes are different, the lines are not parallel.

      }not parallel
     
    
   

  
 

Unlike parallel lines, perpendicular lines do intersect. Their intersection forms a right, or 90-degree, angle. The two lines in  are perpendicular.

Perpendicular lines

Perpendicular lines do not have the same slope. The slopes of perpendicular lines are different from one another in a specific way. The slope of one line is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the other line. The product of a number and its reciprocal is 
 
1.
 
 So, if 
 

   m
   1
  
  and 
   m
   2
  

 
 are negative reciprocals of one another, they can be multiplied together to yield 
 
–1.

   8
  

 
 is 8. To find the negative reciprocal, first find the reciprocal and then change the sign.
As with parallel lines, we can determine whether two lines are perpendicular by comparing their slopes, assuming that the lines are neither horizontal nor vertical. The slope of each line below is the negative reciprocal of the other so the lines are perpendicular.

Parallel lines have the same slope. Because the functions 
 
f(x)=2x+3
 
 and 
 
j(x)=2x−6
 
 each have a slope of 2, they represent parallel lines. Perpendicular lines have negative reciprocal slopes. Because −2 and

 are negative reciprocals, the functions 
 
g(x)=
   1
   2
  
  x−4
 
 and 
 
h(x)=−2x+2
 
 represent perpendicular lines.

Analysis 
A graph of the lines is shown in .

The graph shows that the lines 
 
f(x)=2x+3
 
 and 
 
j(x)=2x–6

g(x)=

  x–4
 
 and 
 
h(x)=−2x+2
 
 are perpendicular.

 
Writing the Equation of a Line Parallel or Perpendicular to a Given Line
If we know the equation of a line, we can use what we know about slope to write the equation of a line that is either parallel or perpendicular to the given line.

Writing Equations of Parallel Lines
Suppose for example, we are given the equation shown.
  
  
   f(x)=3x+1
  
 
 
 We know that the slope of the line formed by the function is 3. We also know that the y-intercept is 
 
(0,1).
 
 Any other line with a slope of 3 will be parallel to 
  
   f(x).
  
  So the lines formed by all of the following functions will be parallel to 
  
   f(x).
  
 
  
 
  
   
    
     
      g(x)
     
    
    
     =
    
    
     
      3x+6
     
    
   
   
    
     
      h(x)
     
    
    
     =
    
    
     
      3x+1
     
    
   
   
    
     
      p(x)
     
    
    
     =
    
    
     
      3x+
       2
       3
      

     
    
   

  
 

Suppose then we want to write the equation of a line that is parallel to 
  
   f
  
  and passes through the point 
 
(1,7).
 
 This type of problem is often described as a point-slope problem because we have a point and a slope. In our example, we know that the slope is 3. We need to determine which value of 
  
   b
  
  will give the correct line. We can begin with the point-slope form of an equation for a line, and then rewrite it in the slope-intercept form. 
 
  
   
    
     
      y−
       y
       1
      

     
    
    
     =
    
    
     
      m(x−
       x
       1
      
      )
     
    
   
   
    
     
      y−7
     
    
    
     =
    
    
     
      3(x−1)
     
    
   
   
    
     
      y−7
     
    
    
     =
    
    
     
      3x−3
     
    
   
   
    
     y
    
    
     =
    
    
     
      3x+4
     
    
   

  
 

So 
  
   g(x)=3x+4
  
  is parallel to 
  
   f(
    x
    )=3x+1
  
  and passes through the point 
 
(1,7).
 

 How To
Given the equation of a function and a point through which its graph passes, write the equation of a line parallel to the given line that passes through the given point.

Find the slope of the function.
Substitute the given values into either the general point-slope equation or the slope-intercept equation for a line.
Simplify.

Finding a Line Parallel to a Given Line
Find a line parallel to the graph of 
 
f(x)=3x+6
 
 that passes through the point 
 
(3,0).
 

The slope of the given line is 3. If we choose the slope-intercept form, we can substitute 
 
m=3,x=3,
 
 and 
 
f(x)=0
 
 into the slope-intercept form to find the y-intercept. 
 
  
   
    
     
      g(x)
     
    
    
     =
    
    
     
      3x+b
     
    
   
   
    
     0
    
    
     =
    
    
     
      3(3)+b
     
    
   
   
    
     b
    
    
     =
    
    
     
      –9
     
    
   

  
 

The line parallel to 
 
f(x)
 
 that passes through 
 
(3,0)
 
 is 
 
g(x)=3x−9.
 

Analysis 
We can confirm that the two lines are parallel by graphing them.  shows that the two lines will never intersect.

Writing Equations of Perpendicular Lines
We can use a very similar process to write the equation for a line perpendicular to a given line. Instead of using the same slope, however, we use the negative reciprocal of the given slope. Suppose we are given the function shown.
 
 
  f(
   x
  )=2x+4
 

The slope of the line is 2, and its negative reciprocal is 
 
−
   1
   2
  
  .
 
 Any function with a slope of 
 
−
   1
   2
  

 
 will be perpendicular to 
 
f(x).
 
 So the lines formed by all of the following functions will be perpendicular to 
 
f(x).
 

 
 
  
   
    
     
      g(x)
     
    
    
     =
    
    
     
      −
       1
       2
      
      x+4
     
    
   
   
    
     
      h(x)
     
    
    
     =
    
    
     
      −
       1
       2
      
      x+2
     
    
   
   
    
     
      p(x)
     
    
    
     =
    
    
     
      −
       1
       2
      
      x−

       2
      

     
    
   

  
 

As before, we can narrow down our choices for a particular perpendicular line if we know that it passes through a given point. Suppose then we want to write the equation of a line that is perpendicular to 
 
f(x)
 
 and passes through the point 
 
(4,0).
 
 We already know that the slope is 
 
−
   1
   2
  
  .
 
 Now we can use the point to find the y-intercept by substituting the given values into the slope-intercept form of a line and solving for 
 
b.
 

 
 
  
   
    
     
      g(x)
     
    
    
     =
    
    
     
      mx+b
     
    
   
   
    
     0
    
    
     =
    
    
     
      −
       1
       2
      
      (4)+b
     
    
   
   
    
     0
    
    
     =
    
    
     
      −2+b
     
    
   
   
    
     2
    
    
     =
    
    
     b
    
   
   
    
     b
    
    
     =
    
    
     2
    
   

  
 

The equation for the function with a slope of 
 
−
   1
   2
  

 
 and a y-intercept of 2 is
 
 
  g(x)=−
   1
   2
  
  x+2
 

So 
 
g(x)=−
   1
   2
  
  x+2
 
 is perpendicular to 
 
f(
   x
  )=2x+4
 
 and passes through the point 
 
(4,0).
 
 Be aware that perpendicular lines may not look obviously perpendicular on a graphing calculator unless we use the square zoom feature.
Q&A
A horizontal line has a slope of zero and a vertical line has an undefined slope. These two lines are perpendicular, but the product of their slopes is not –1. Doesn’t this fact contradict the definition of perpendicular lines?
No. For two perpendicular linear functions, the product of their slopes is –1. However, a vertical line is not a function so the definition is not contradicted.

Key Concepts
Linear functions can be represented in words, function notation, tabular form, and graphical form. See .
An increasing linear function results in a graph that slants upward from left to right and has a positive slope. A decreasing linear function results in a graph that slants downward from left to right and has a negative slope. A constant linear function results in a graph that is a horizontal line. See .
Slope is a rate of change. The slope of a linear function can be calculated by dividing the difference between y-values by the difference in corresponding x-values of any two points on the line. See  and .
An equation for a linear function can be written from a graph. See .
The equation for a linear function can be written if the slope 
 
m
 
 and initial value 
 
b
 
 are known. See  and .
A linear function can be used to solve real-world problems given information in different forms. See , , and .
Linear functions can be graphed by plotting points or by using the y-intercept and slope. See  and .
Graphs of linear functions may be transformed by using shifts up, down, left, or right, as well as through stretches, compressions, and reflections. See .
The equation for a linear function can be written by interpreting the graph. See .
The x-intercept is the point at which the graph of a linear function crosses the x-axis. See .
Horizontal lines are written in the form, 
 
f(x)=b.
 
 See .
Vertical lines are written in the form, 
 
x=b.
 
 See .
Parallel lines have the same slope. Perpendicular lines have negative reciprocal slopes, assuming neither is vertical. See .
A line parallel to another line, passing through a given point, may be found by substituting the slope value of the line and the x- and y-values of the given point into the equation, 
 
f(x)=mx+b,
 
 and using the 
 
b
 
 that results. Similarly, the point-slope form of an equation can also be used. See .
A line perpendicular to another line, passing through a given point, may be found in the same manner, with the exception of using the negative reciprocal slope. See  and .

f(

 what is the point of intersection? Explain why what you found is the point of intersection.
The point of intersection is 
 
(
   
    a,a
   
  ).
 
 This is because for the horizontal line, all of the 
 
y
 
 coordinates are 
 
a
 
 and for the vertical line, all of the

 coordinates are 
 
a.
 
 The point of intersection is on both lines and therefore will have these two characteristics.
