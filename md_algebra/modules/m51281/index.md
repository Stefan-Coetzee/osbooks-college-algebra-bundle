Solve direct variation problems (IA 7.5.5).Objective 1: Solve a formula for a specific variable (IA 2.3.1).
It is often helpful to solve a formula for a specific variable. If you need to put a formula in a spreadsheet, it is not unusual to have to solve it for a specific variable first. We isolate that variable on one side of the equals sign and all other variables and constants are on the other side of the equal sign.

Solve the formula V=13πr2h for h.

Write the formula.

Remove the fraction on the right.

Simplify.

Divide both sides by πr2. 

We could now use this formula to find the height of a right circular cone when we know the volume and the radius of the base, by using the formula h=3Vπr2.

Objective 2: Solve direct variation problems (IA 7.5.5)Lindsay gets paid $15 per hour at her job. If we let s be her salary and h be the number of hours she has worked, we could model this situation with the equation S=15h .
Lindsay’s salary is the product of a constant, 15, and the number of hours she works. We say that Lindsay’s salary varies directly with the number of hours she works. Two variables vary directly if one is the product of a constant and the other.Which graph represents direct variation and why?

A pre-owned car dealer has just offered their best candidate, Nicole, a position in sales. The position offers 16% commission on her sales. Her earnings depend on the amount of her sales. For instance, if she sells a vehicle for $4,600, she will earn $736. As she considers the offer, she takes into account the typical price of the dealer's cars, the overall market, and how many she can reasonably expect to sell. In this section, we will look at relationships, such as this one, between earnings, sales, and commission rate.

 Solving Direct Variation ProblemsIn the example above, Nicole’s earnings can be found by multiplying her sales by her commission. The formula 
   
    e=0.16s
   tells us her earnings, 
   
    e,
   come from the product of 0.16, her commission, and the sale price of the vehicle. If we create a table, we observe that as the sales price increases, the earnings increase as well, which should be intuitive. See .

       , sales price
       
       
        e=0.16s
      
      
      Interpretation 
     
    
    
     
      $4,600
       
       
        e=0.16(
         
          4,600
         )=736
      
      
      A sale of a $4,600 vehicle results in $736 earnings.
     
     
      $9,200
       
       
        e=0.16(
         
          9,200
         )=1,472
      
      
      A sale of a $9,200 vehicle results in $1472 earnings.
     
     
      $18,400
       
       
        e=0.16(
         
          18,400
         )=2,944
      
      
      A sale of a $18,400 vehicle results in $2944 earnings.
     
    

Notice that earnings are a multiple of sales. As sales increase, earnings increase in a predictable way. Double the sales of the vehicle from $4,600 to $9,200, and we double the earnings from $736 to $1,472. As the input increases, the output increases as a multiple of the input. A relationship in which one quantity is a constant multiplied by another quantity is called direct variation. Each variable in this type of relationship varies directly with the other. represents the data for Nicole’s potential earnings. We say that earnings vary directly with the sales price of the car. The formula 
   
    y=k
     x
     n
    
    
   is used for direct variation. The value 
   
    k
   is a nonzero constant greater than zero and is called the constant of variation. In this case, 
   
    k=0.16
   and 
    n=1.
    We saw functions like this one when we discussed power functions.
  
   
    
   
  

  Direct Variation

  xandy
 
 are related by an equation of the form 
    y=k
      x
      n
     
     
   
   
   then we say that the relationship is direct variation and 
    y
   
    varies directly with, or is proportional to, the 
     
     n
    th power of 
 
  x.
 
 In direct variation relationships, there is a nonzero constant ratio 
     
     k=
       y
       
        
         x
         n
        
       
      
      ,
     where 
     
     k
     is called the constant of variation, which help defines the relationship between the variables.

Identify the input, 
 
  x,
 
 and the output, 
     
     y.
    
    
    Determine the constant of variation. You may need to divide 
     
     y
     by the specified power of 
     
     x
     to determine the constant of variation.
   Use the constant of variation to write an equation for the relationship.
    Substitute known values into the equation to find the unknown.
   

  
     Solving a Direct Variation Problem
     The quantity 
      
      y
      varies directly with the cube of 
      
      x.
      If 
      
      y=25
      when 
      
      x=2,
      find 
      
      y
      when 
      
      x
      is 6.
    
    
     The general formula for direct variation with a cube is

      The constant can be found by dividing 
       y

       x.

 Solving Inverse Variation ProblemsWater temperature in an ocean varies inversely to the water’s depth. The formula 
   
    T=
     
      14,000
     d
    
    
   gives us the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit at a depth in feet below Earth’s surface. Consider the Atlantic Ocean, which covers 22% of Earth’s surface. At a certain location, at the depth of 500 feet, the temperature may be 28°F.If we create , we observe that, as the depth increases, the water temperature decreases.

      At a depth of 2,000 ft, the water temperature is 7° F.
     
    

We notice in the relationship between these variables that, as one quantity increases, the other decreases. The two quantities are said to be inversely proportional and each term varies inversely with the other. Inversely proportional relationships are also called inverse variations.
  For our example,  depicts the inverse variation. We say the water temperature varies inversely with the depth of the water because, as the depth increases, the temperature decreases. The formula 
   
    y=
     k
     x
    
    
   for inverse variation in this case uses 
   
    k=14,000.
  
  
   
    
   
  

  Inverse Variation

    If

    and 
    y
    are related by an equation of the form

    
 
  y=
   k
   
    
     x
     n
    
    
  

where 
    k
    is a nonzero constant, then we say that 
 
  y
 
 varies inversely with the 
    nth
    power of 
    x.
    In inversely proportional relationships, or inverse variations, there is a constant multiple 
    k=
      x
      n
     
     y.
   
   
   
     Writing a Formula for an Inversely Proportional Relationship
     A tourist plans to drive 100 miles. Find a formula for the time the trip will take as a function of the speed the tourist drives.
    
    
     Recall that multiplying speed by time gives distance. If we let 
      
      t
      represent the drive time in hours, and 
      
      v
      represent the velocity (speed or rate) at which the tourist drives, then 
      
      vt=distance.
      Because the distance is fixed at 100 miles, 
      
      vt=100
      so 
 
  t=100/v.
 
 Because time is a function of velocity, we can write 
 
  t(v).
 

 
 
  
   
    
     
      t(v)
     
    
    
     =
    
    
     
      
       
        100
       
       v
      

     
    
   
   
    
    
     =
    
    
     
      100
       v
       
        −1
       
      

     
    
   

  
 

We can see that the constant of variation is 100 and, although we can write the relationship using the negative exponent, it is more common to see it written as a fraction. We say that time varies inversely with velocity.

Solving Problems Involving Joint Variation
  Many situations are more complicated than a basic direct variation or inverse variation model. One variable often depends on multiple other variables. When a variable is dependent on the product or quotient of two or more variables, this is called joint variation. For example, the cost of busing students for each school trip varies with the number of students attending and the distance from the school. The variable 
 
  c,
 
 cost, varies jointly with the number of students, 
 
  n,
 
 and the distance, 
   
    d.
  
  

Joint Variation
Joint variation occurs when a variable varies directly or inversely with multiple variables.For instance, if 
  
   x
  varies directly with both 
  
   y
  and 
  
   z,
  we have 
  
   x=kyz.
  If 
  
   x
  varies directly with 
  
   y
  and inversely with 
  
z,
  we have 
  
   x=
    
     ky
    z
   
   .
  Notice that we only use one constant in a joint variation equation.

   z=27.
 
 

Begin by writing an equation to show the relationship between the variables.

 
 
  x=
   
    k
     y
     2
    

   
   
    
     z
     3
    

   
  

 

Substitute 
  
   x=6,
  
  
   y=2,
  and 
  
   z=8
  to find the value of the constant 
  
   k.
 
 
 
 
  
   
    
     6
    
    
     =
    
    
     
      
       
        k
         2
         2
        

       
       
        
         8
         3
        

       
      

     
    
   
   
    
     6
    
    
     =
    
    
     
      
       
        4k
       
       2
      

     
    
   
   
    
     3
    
    
     =
    
    
     k
    
   

  
 

Now we can substitute the value of the constant into the equation for the relationship.
 
  
   x=
    
     3
      y
      2
     
    
    
     
      z
      3
     
    
   
  
 

 To find 
  
   x
  when 
  
   y=1
  and 
  
   z=27,
  we will substitute values for 
  
   y
  and 
  
   z
  into our equation.
 
 
  
   
    
     x
    
    
     =
    
    
     
      
       
        3
         
          (1)
         
         2
        

       
       
        
         
          27
         
         3
        

       
      

     
    
   
   
    
    
     =
    
    
     1
