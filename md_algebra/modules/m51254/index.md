Solving a Formula for a Specified Variable.
===========================================
Refer to the appropriate formula and identify the variable you are solving for. Treat the other variable terms as if they were numbers.
Bring all terms containing the specified variable to one side using the addition/subtraction property of equality. 
Isolate the variable you are solving for using the multiplication/division property of equality.

Solve a Formula for a Specific Variable
=======================================

  The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is found using the formula: $P=2l+2w$ .
  Solve this formula in terms of *l*.

![.](../../media/CNX_Coreq_Figure_02_03_001_img.jpg)

$P=2l+2w$ 
Since we are solving for *l* we isolate the *l* term

 $P-2w=2l+2w-2w$ 
Subtract 2*w* from both sides.

 $P-2w=2l$ 
Combine like terms

 $\frac{P-2w}{2}=\frac{2l}{2}$ 
Divide by 2 to isolate *l*.

 $\frac{P-2w}{2}=l$ 
Simplify

Many real-world applications can be modeled by linear equations. For example, a cell phone package may include a monthly service fee plus a charge per minute of talk-time; it costs a widget manufacturer a certain amount to produce *x*widgets per month plus monthly operating charges; a car rental company charges a daily fee plus an amount per mile driven. These are examples of applications we come across every day that are modeled by linear equations. In this section, we will set up and use linear equations to solve such problems.

Setting up a Linear Equation to Solve a Real-World Application
==============================================================
To set up or model a linear equation to fit a real-world application, we must first determine the known quantities and define the unknown quantity as a variable. Then, we begin to interpret the words as mathematical expressions using mathematical symbols. Let us use the car rental example above. In this case, a known cost, such as $0.10/mi, is multiplied by an unknown quantity, the number of miles driven. Therefore, we can write $0.10x.$ This expression represents a variable cost because it changes according to the number of miles driven.
If a quantity is independent of a variable, we usually just add or subtract it, according to the problem. As these amounts do not change, we call them fixed costs. Consider a car rental agency that charges $0.10/mi plus a daily fee of $50. We can use these quantities to model an equation that can be used to find the daily car rental cost $C.$

 $$
C=0.10x+50
$$

=============================================================

Find a linear equation to solve for the following unknown quantities: One number exceeds another number by $17$ and their sum is $31.$ Find the two numbers.

Let $x$ equal the first number. Then, as the second number exceeds the first by 17, we can write the second number as $x+17.$ The sum of the two numbers is 31. We usually interpret the word *is* as an equal sign.

 $$

Setting Up a Linear Equation to Solve a Real-World Application
==============================================================

There are two cell phone companies that offer different packages. Company A charges a monthly service fee of $34 plus $.05/min talk-time. Company B charges a monthly service fee of $40 plus $.04/min talk-time.

ⓐWrite a linear equation that models the packages offered by both companies.
ⓑ If the average number of minutes used each month is 1,160, which company offers the better plan?
ⓒIf the average number of minutes used each month is 420, which company offers the better plan?
ⓓHow many minutes of talk-time would yield equal monthly statements from both companies?

ⓐThe model for Company *A* can be written as $A=0.05x+34.$ This includes the variable cost of $0.05x$ plus the monthly service charge of $34. Company *B*’s package charges a higher monthly fee of $40, but a lower variable cost of $0.04x.$ Company *B*’s model can be written as $B=0.04x+\text{\$}40.$ 
ⓑIf the average number of minutes used each month is 1,160, we have the following:

 $$
\begin{array}{ccc}\hfill \text{Company\}A& =& 0.05(1,160)+34\hfill \\ & =& 58+34\hfill \\ & =& 92\hfill \\ \hfill \text{Company\}B& =& 0.04(1,160)+40\hfill \\ & =& 46.4+40\hfill \\ \hfill & =& 86.4\hfill \end{array}
$$ So, Company *B* offers the lower monthly cost of $86.40 as compared with the $92 monthly cost offered by Company *A* when the average number of minutes used each month is 1,160.

ⓒIf the average number of minutes used each month is 420, we have the following:

 $$
\begin{array}{ccc}\hfill \text{Company\}A& =& 0.05(420)+34\hfill \\ & =& 21+34\hfill \\ & =& 55\hfill \\ \hfill \text{Company\}B& =& 0.04(420)+40\hfill \\ & =& 16.8+40\hfill \\ & =& 56.8\hfill \end{array}
$$
If the average number of minutes used each month is 420, then Company *A*offers a lower monthly cost of $55 compared to Company *B*’s monthly cost of $56.80.

 ⓓTo answer the question of how many talk-time minutes would yield the same bill from both companies, we should think about the problem in terms of $\left(x,y\right)$ coordinates: At what point are both the *x-*value and the *y-*value equal? We can find this point by setting the equations equal to each other and solving for *x.*

 $$
\begin{array}{ccc}\hfill 0.05x+34& =& 0.04x+40\hfill \\ \hfill 0.01x& =& 6\hfill \\ \hfill x& =& 600\hfill \end{array}
$$
Check the *x-*value in each equation.

 $$
\begin{array}{ccc}\hfill 0.05(600)+34& =& 64\hfill \\ \hfill 0.04(600)+40& =& 64\hfill \end{array}
$$ 
Therefore, a monthly average of 600 talk-time minutes renders the plans equal. See

The company has monthly operating expenses of $350 for utilities and $3,300 for salaries. What are the company’s monthly expenses?

$C=2.5x+3,650$

Using a Formula to Solve a Real-World Application
=================================================

Many applications are solved using known formulas. The problem is stated, a formula is identified, the known quantities are substituted into the formula, the equation is solved for the unknown, and the problem’s question is answered. Typically, these problems involve two equations representing two trips, two investments, two areas, and so on. Examples of formulas include the **area** of a rectangular region, $A=LW;$ the **perimeter** of a rectangle, $P=2L+2W;$ and the **volume** of a rectangular solid, $V=LWH.$ When there are two unknowns, we find a way to write one in terms of the other because we can solve for only one variable at a time.

Solving an Application Using a Formula
======================================

It takes Andrew 30 min to drive to work in the morning. He drives home using the same route, but it takes 10 min longer, and he averages 10 mi/h less than in the morning. How far does Andrew drive to work?

This is a distance problem, so we can use the formula $d=rt,$ where distance equals rate multiplied by time. Note that when rate is given in mi/h, time must be expressed in hours. Consistent units of measurement are key to obtaining a correct solution.

First, we identify the known and unknown quantities. Andrew’s morning drive to work takes 30 min, or $\frac{1}{2}$ h at rate $r.$ His drive home takes 40 min, or $\frac{2}{3}$ h, and his speed averages 10 mi/h less than the morning drive. Both trips cover distance $d.$ A table, such as , is often helpful for keeping track of information in these types of problems.

 $d$ 
 $r$ 
 $t$ 

*To Work*
 $d$ 
 $r$ 
 $\frac{1}{2}$ 

*To Home*
 $d$ 
 $r-10$ 
 $\frac{2}{3}$ 

Write two equations, one for each trip.

 $$
\begin{array}{cccc}\hfill d& =& r\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\hfill & \phantom{\rule{2em}{0ex}}\text{To\ work}\hfill \\ \hfill d& =& (r-10)\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)\hfill & \phantom{\rule{2em}{0ex}}\text{To\ home}\hfill \end{array}
$$
As both equations equal the same distance, we set them equal to each other and solve for *r*.

 $$
\begin{array}{ccc}\hfill r\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)& =& (r-10)\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)\hfill \\ \hfill \frac{1}{2}r& =& \frac{2}{3}r-\frac{20}{3}\hfill \\ \hfill \frac{1}{2}r-\frac{2}{3}r& =& -\frac{20}{3}\hfill \\ \hfill -\frac{1}{6}r& =& -\frac{20}{3}\hfill \\ \hfill r& =& -\frac{20}{3}(\mathrm{-6})\hfill \\ \hfill r& =& 40\hfill \end{array}
$$
We have solved for the rate of speed to work, 40 mph. Substituting 40 into the rate on the return trip yields 30 mi/h. Now we can answer the question. Substitute the rate back into either equation and solve for *d.*

 $$
\begin{array}{ccc}\hfill d& =& 40\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\hfill \\ & =& 20\hfill \end{array}
$$
The distance between home and work is 20 mi.

Analysis
========

Note that we could have cleared the fractions in the equation by multiplying both sides of the equation by the LCD to solve for $r.$

 $$
\begin{array}{ccc}\hfill r\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)& =& (r-10)\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)\hfill \\ \hfill 6\phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}\text{}\times \phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}\text{}r\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)& =& 6\phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}\text{}\times \phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}\text{}(r-10)\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)\hfill \\ \hfill 3r& =& 4(r-10)\hfill \\ \hfill 3r& =& 4r-40\hfill \\ \hfill -r& =& \mathrm{-40}\hfill \\ \hfill r& =& 40\hfill \end{array}
$$

45 mi/h

Solving a Perimeter Problem
===========================

The perimeter of a rectangular outdoor patio is $54$ ft. The length is $3$ ft greater than the width. What are the dimensions of the patio?

The perimeter formula is standard: $P=2L+2W.$ We have two unknown quantities, length and width. However, we can write the length in terms of the width as $L=W+3.$ Substitute the perimeter value and the expression for length into the formula. It is often helpful to make a sketch and label the sides as in .

\n\n![Image](../../media/CNX_CAT_Figure_02_03_003.jpg)\n\n
Now we can solve for the width and then calculate the length.

 $$
\begin{array}{ccc}\hfill P& =& 2L+2W\hfill \\ \hfill 54& =& 2(W+3)+2W\hfill \\ \hfill 54& =& 2W+6+2W\hfill \\ \hfill 54& =& 4W+6\hfill \\ \hfill 48& =& 4W\hfill \\ \hfill 12& =& W\hfill \\ \hfill (12+3)& =& L\hfill \\ \hfill 15& =& L\hfill \end{array}
$$

The dimensions are $L=15$ ft and $W=12$ ft.

Try It
Find the dimensions of a rectangle given that the perimeter is $110$ cm and the length is 1 cm more than twice the width.

$L=37$ cm, $W=18$ cm

Solving an Area Problem
=======================

The perimeter of a tablet of graph paper is 48 in. The length is $6$ in. more than the width. Find the area of the graph paper.

The standard formula for area is $A=LW;$ however, we will solve the problem using the perimeter formula. The reason we use the perimeter formula is because we know enough information about the perimeter that the formula will allow us to solve for one of the unknowns. As both perimeter and area use length and width as dimensions, they are often used together to solve a problem such as this one.

We know that the length is 6 in. more than the width, so we can write length as $L=W+6.$ Substitute the value of the perimeter and the expression for length into the perimeter formula and find the length.

 $$
\begin{array}{ccc}\hfill P& =& 2L+2W\hfill \\ \hfill 48& =& 2(W+6)+2W\hfill \\ \hfill 48& =& 2W+12+2W\hfill \\ \hfill 48& =& 4W+12\hfill \\ \hfill 36& =& 4W\hfill \\ \hfill 9& =& W\hfill \\ \hfill (9+6)& =& L\hfill \\ \hfill 15& =& L\hfill \end{array}
$$

Now, we find the area given the dimensions of $L=15$ in. and $W=9$ in.

 $$
\begin{array}{ccc}\hfill A& =& LW\hfill \\ \hfill A& =& 15(9)\hfill \\ & =& \hfill 135\phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}\text{in}{\text{.}}^{2}\end{array}
$$
The area is $135$ in.2.

Try It
A game room has a perimeter of 70 ft. The length is five more than twice the width. How many ft2 of new carpeting should be ordered?

250 ft2

Solving a Volume Problem
========================

Find the dimensions of a shipping box given that the length is twice the width, the height is $8$ inches, and the volume is 1,600 in.3.

The formula for the volume of a box is given as $V=LWH,$ the product of length, width, and height. We are given that $L=2W,$ and $H=8.$ The volume is $\mathrm{1,600}$ cubic inches.

 $$
\begin{array}{ccc}\hfill V& =& LWH\hfill \\ \hfill 1,600& =& (2W)W(8)\hfill \\ \hfill 1,600& =& 16{W}^{2}\hfill \\ \hfill 100& =& {W}^{2}\hfill \\ \hfill 10& =& W\hfill \end{array}
$$
The dimensions are $L=20$ in., $W=10$ in., and $H=8$ in.

Analysis
========

Note that the square root of ${W}^{2}$ would result in a positive and a negative value. However, because we are describing width, we can use only the positive result.
