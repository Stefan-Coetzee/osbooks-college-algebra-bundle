Objective 1: Dividing polynomials using long division (IA 5.4.3)To divide a polynomial by a binomial, we follow a procedure very similar to long division of numbers. So, let’s look carefully at the steps we take when we divide a 3-digit number, 875, by a 2-digit number, 25.
Long division of numbers
    

When we divided 875 by 25, we had no remainder. But sometimes division of numbers does leave a remainder.

Practice Makes PerfectVocabulary of the example. Fill in the blanks.
  When dividing 69 by 4,
the dividend is_________, the divisor is________,    the quotient is________, and the remainder is________.We check division by multiplying the quotient by the divisor and adding the remainder.

Dividing of polynomials has very similar steps to the numerical example above.
Find the quotient: (x2+9x+20)÷(x+5). 

Write it as a long division problem.Be sure the dividend is written in descending order of powers, with no missing terms.

Divide x2 by x. It may help to ask yourself, “What do I needto multiply x by to get x2 ?”

Put the answer, x, in the quotient over the x term.Multiply x times x+5. Line up the like terms under the dividend.

Subtract x2+5x from x2+9x. You may find it easier to change the signs and then add.Then bring down the last term, 20.

Divide 4x by x. It may help to ask yourself, “What do Ineed to multiply x by to get 4x ?”Put the answer, 4 , in the quotient over the constant term.

Multiply 4 times x+5. 

Subtract 4x+20 from 4x+20. 

Check:Multiply the quotient by the divisor. (x+4)(x+5) You should get the dividend. x2+9x+20✓

Divide using long division of polynomials: (x2+10x+21)÷(x+3)
  

Sometimes division of polynomials, just like division of numbers, leaves a remainder. We write the remainder as a fraction with the divisor as the denominator.

Also, if you look back at the dividends in previous examples, you will notice that the terms were written in descending order of degrees, and there were no missing degrees.

 (5x+x4-x2-6)÷(x+2)
  

  Notice, this polynomial is not in descending order and it is missing x3 term. We need to write it in the correct order and add 0x3 as a placeholder.
  
  
    
  

To check, multiply divisor by the quotient and add remainder (x+2)(x3-2x2+3x-1)-4 
The result should be x4-x2+5x-6

Objective 2: Dividing polynomials using synthetic division (IA 5.4.4)As you probably noticed, long division can be tedious. Synthetic division uses the patterns from long division as a basis to make a process much simpler by leaving the variable terms out. The same example in synthetic division format is shown next.

  
    
  

Synthetic division only works when the divisor is of the form (x−c).
  
Use synthetic division to find the quotient and remainder when x4-16x2+3x+12 is divided by x+4. Note that the divisor is in the form x-(-4), so use c as the divisor.
  

  
The polynomial x4-16x2+3x+12 has its term in order with descending degree but we notice there is no x3term. We will add a 0 as a placeholder for the x3 term.
  

  
    
  

We divided a 4th degree polynomial by a 1st degree polynomial so the quotient will be a 3rd degree polynomial. Reading from the third row, the quotient has the coefficients 1,−4,0, and 3, which is x3-4x2+0x+3  . The remainder is 0.

  Lincoln Memorial, Washington, D.C. (credit: Ron Cogswell, Flickr)The exterior of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., is a large rectangular solid with length 61.5 meters (m), width 40 m, and height 30 m.National Park Service. "Lincoln Memorial Building Statistics." http://www.nps.gov/linc/historyculture/lincoln-memorial-building-statistics.htm. Accessed 4/3/2014 We can easily find the volume using elementary geometry.

 
 
  
   
    V
    =
    l⋅w⋅h
   
   
    
    =
    61.5⋅40⋅30
   
   
    
    =
    73,800
   

  

So the volume is 73,800 cubic meters 
   
    (
     
      m³
     
     ).   
  
   Suppose we knew the volume, length, and width. We could divide to find the height.

 
 
  
   
    h
    =
    Vl⋅w
   
   
    
    =
    73,80061.5⋅40
   
   
    
    =
    30
   
  

As we can confirm from the dimensions above, the height is 30 m. We can use similar methods to find any of the missing dimensions. We can also use the same method if any, or all, of the measurements contain variable expressions. For example, suppose the volume of a rectangular solid is given by the polynomial 
   
    3
     x
     4
    
    −3
     x
     3
    
    −33
     x
     2
    
    +54x.   
  
   The length of the solid is given by 
 
  3x;
 

   the width is given by 
    
     x−2.
    
       To find the height of the solid, we can use polynomial division, which is the focus of this section.Using Long Division to Divide PolynomialsWe are familiar with the long division algorithm for ordinary arithmetic. We begin by dividing into the digits of the dividend that have the greatest place value. We divide, multiply, subtract, include the digit in the next place value position, and repeat. For example, let’s divide 178 by 3 using long division.

    
     
    

   Another way to look at the solution is as a sum of parts. This should look familiar, since it is the same method used to check division in elementary arithmetic.

   
 
 
  
   
    dividend
    =
    (divisor⋅quotient) + remainder
   
   
    178
    =
    (3⋅59)+1
   
   
    
    =
    177+1
   
   
    
    =
    178
   

  

We call this the Division Algorithm and will discuss it more formally after looking at an example.
   Division of polynomials that contain more than one term has similarities to long division of whole numbers. We can write a polynomial dividend as the product of the divisor and the quotient added to the remainder. The terms of the polynomial division correspond to the digits (and place values) of the whole number division. This method allows us to divide two polynomials. For example, if we were to divide 
    
     2
      x
      3
     
     −3
      x
      2
     
     +4x+5
    
        by 
     
      x+2
     
         using the long division algorithm, it would look like this:

We have found
    
    
     
      
       2
        x
        3
       
       −3
        x
        2
       
       +4x+5
      
      
       x+2
      
     
     =2
      x

       31
      
      
       x+2
      
     

    
   
   
   or

     x

     2
    
    +4x+5
   
  =(x+2)(2
   x
   2
  
  −7x+18)−31
 

We can identify the dividend, the divisor, the quotient, and the remainder.

    
     
    

   Writing the result in this manner illustrates the Division Algorithm.

   The Division Algorithm

    The Division Algorithm states that, given a polynomial dividend 
     
      f(x)
     
          and a non-zero polynomial divisor 
      
   d(x)
      
     
     where the degree of 
      
   d(x)
      
     
     is less than or equal to the degree of 
 
  f(x)
 , there exist unique polynomials 
      
   q(x)
      
     
     and 
      
   r(x)
      
     
     such that

     
     
      f(x)=d(x)q(x)+r(x)
     
    
    
     
     
      q(x)
     
          is the quotient and 
      
   r(x)
      
     
     is the remainder. The remainder is either equal to zero or has degree strictly less than 
      
   d(x).
      
     
    
    If 
     
      r(x)=0,
     
          then 
      
   d(x)
      
     
     divides evenly into 
      
   f(x).
      
     
     This means that, in this case, both 
      
   d(x)
      
     
     and 
      
   q(x)
      
     
     are factors of 
      
   f(x).
      
     
    
   How To
    Given a polynomial and a binomial, use long division to divide the polynomial by the binomial.

Set up the division problem.
     Determine the first term of the quotient by dividing the leading term of the dividend by the leading term of the divisor.
     Multiply the answer by the divisor and write it below the like terms of the dividend.
     Subtract the bottom binomial from the top binomial.
     Bring down the next term of the dividend.
     Repeat steps 2–5 until reaching the last term of the dividend.
     If the remainder is non-zero, express as a fraction using the divisor as the denominator.
   
      Using Long Division to Divide a Second-Degree Polynomial

       by 
        x+1.
        
       
      
     
     

The quotient is 
      
   5x−2.
      
     
      The remainder is 0. We write the result as
 
      
       
        
         5
          x
          2
         
         +3x−2
        
        
         x+1
        
       
       =5x−2

    x+1
   
  )(
   
    5x−2
   
  )
 

     
      Analysis 
      This division problem had a remainder of 0. This tells us that the dividend is divided evenly by the divisor, and that the divisor is a factor of the dividend.

  Using Synthetic Division to Divide PolynomialsAs we’ve seen, long division of polynomials can involve many steps and be quite cumbersome. Synthetic division is a shorthand method of dividing polynomials for the special case of dividing by a linear factor whose leading coefficient is 1.
    To illustrate the process, recall the example at the beginning of the section.
    Divide 
 
  2
   x
   3
  
  −3
   x
   2
  
  +4x+5
 

by 
 
  x+2
 

using the long division algorithm.
    The final form of the process looked like this:

There is a lot of repetition in the table. If we don’t write the variables but, instead, line up their coefficients in columns under the division sign and also eliminate the partial products, we already have a simpler version of the entire problem.

     
      
     

    Synthetic division carries this simplification even a few more steps. Collapse the table by moving each of the rows up to fill any vacant spots. Also, instead of dividing by 2, as we would in division of whole numbers, then multiplying and subtracting the middle product, we change the sign of the “divisor” to –2, multiply and add. The process starts by bringing down the leading coefficient.

      
     
We then multiply it by the “divisor” and add, repeating this process column by column, until there are no entries left. The bottom row represents the coefficients of the quotient; the last entry of the bottom row is the remainder. In this case, the quotient is 
 
  2
   x
   2
  
  –7x+18
 and the remainder is 
 
  –31.
 

The process will be made more clear in .

     Synthetic Division
     Synthetic division is a shortcut that can be used when the divisor is a binomial in the form 
 
  x−k
 
 where 
 
  k
 
 is a real number.

In synthetic division, only the coefficients are used in the division process.

    
     How To
     Given two polynomials, use synthetic division to divide.

     
      Write 
 
  k
 

for the divisor.
     Write the coefficients of the dividend.
     Bring the lead coefficient down.
     Multiply the lead coefficient by 
 
  k.
 

Write the product in the next column.
     Add the terms of the second column.
     Multiply the result by 
 
  k.
 

Write the product in the next column.
     Repeat steps 5 and 6 for the remaining columns.
     Use the bottom numbers to write the quotient. The number in the last column is the remainder. The next number from the right has degree 0, the next number has degree 1, and so on.
     
    
    
     
       Using Synthetic Division to Divide a Second-Degree Polynomial
       Use synthetic division to divide 
 
  5
   x
   2
  
  −3x−36
 

by 
 
  x−3.
 

      
      
       Begin by setting up the synthetic division. Write 
 
  k
 

and the coefficients.

       
        
       

      Bring down the lead coefficient. Multiply the lead coefficient by 
 
  k.
 

       
        
       
      Continue by adding the numbers in the second column. Multiply the resulting number by 
 
  k.
 

Write the result in the next column. Then add the numbers in the third column.

       
        
       

      The result is 
 
  5x+12.
 

The remainder is 0. So 
 
  x−3
 

is a factor of the original polynomial.

       Analysis 
       Just as with long division, we can check our work by multiplying the quotient by the divisor and adding the remainder.

        
 
  (x−3)(5x+12)+0=5

   x
   2
  
  −6x−20
 

by 
 
  x+2.
 
 

      
      
       The binomial divisor is 
 
  x+2
 

so 
 
  k=−2.
 

Add each column, multiply the result by –2, and repeat until the last column is reached.
        
       

      The result is 
 
  4
   x
   2
  
  +2x−10.
 

The remainder is 0. Thus,

   Using Polynomial Division to Solve Application Problems
   Polynomial division can be used to solve a variety of application problems involving expressions for area and volume. We looked at an application at the beginning of this section. Now we will solve that problem in the following example.

   
      Using Polynomial Division in an Application Problem
      The volume of a rectangular solid is given by the polynomial 
 
  3
   x
   4
  
  −3
   x
   3
  
  −33
   x
   2
  
  +54x.
 

The length of the solid is given by 
 
  3x
 

and the width is given by 
 
  x−2.
 

Find the height, 
 
  h,
 
 of the solid.
     
      There are a few ways to approach this problem. We need to divide the expression for the volume of the solid by the expressions for the length and width. Let us create a sketch as in .

     
      
       
      
     
     We can now write an equation by substituting the known values into the formula for the volume of a rectangular solid.
 
 
  
   
    
     V
    
    
     =
    
    
     
      l⋅w⋅h

       x

     =
    
    
     
      3x⋅(x−2)⋅h
    
   

  
 
To solve for 
 
  h,
 
 first divide both sides by 
 
  3x.
 

 
 
  
   
    
     
      
       
        3x⋅(x−2)⋅h

Key ConceptsPolynomial long division can be used to divide a polynomial by any polynomial with equal or lower degree. See  and .
    The Division Algorithm tells us that a polynomial dividend can be written as the product of the divisor and the quotient added to the remainder.
    Synthetic division is a shortcut that can be used to divide a polynomial by a binomial in the form 
 
  x−k.

  Division Algorithm
  given a polynomial dividend 
 
  f(x)
 

and a non-zero polynomial divisor 
 
  d(x)
 

where the degree of 
 
  d(x)
 

is less than or equal to the degree of 
 
  f(x)
 , there exist unique polynomials 
 
  q(x)
 

and 
 
  r(x)
 

such that 
 
  f(x)=d(x)q(x)+r(x)
 

where 
 
  q(x)
 

is the quotient and 
 
  r(x)
 

is the remainder. The remainder is either equal to zero or has degree strictly less than 
 
  d(x).
