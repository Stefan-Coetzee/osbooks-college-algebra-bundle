Objective 2: Graph Logarithmic functions. (IA 10.3.3)To graph a logarithmic function y=logax  , it is easiest to convert the equation to its exponential form, x=ay . Generally, when we look for ordered pairs for the graph of a function, we usually choose an x-value and then determine its corresponding y-value. In this case you may find it easier to choose y-values and then determine its corresponding x-value.

In Graphs of Exponential Functions, we saw how creating a graphical representation of an exponential model gives us another layer of insight for predicting future events. How do logarithmic graphs give us insight into situations? Because every logarithmic function is the inverse function of an exponential function, we can think of every output on a logarithmic graph as the input for the corresponding inverse exponential equation. In other words, logarithms give the cause for an effect.To illustrate, suppose we invest 

$2500

 in an account that offers an annual interest rate of 

5%,

 compounded continuously. We already know that the balance in our account for any year 

t

 can be found with the equation 

A=2500
e

0.05t

.

 But what if we wanted to know the year for any balance? We would need to create a corresponding new function by interchanging the input and the output; thus we would need to create a logarithmic model for this situation. By graphing the model, we can see the output (year) for any input (account balance). For instance, what if we wanted to know how many years it would take for our initial investment to double?  shows this point on the logarithmic graph.

In this section we will discuss the values for which a logarithmic function is defined, and then turn our attention to graphing the family of logarithmic functions.

Finding the Domain of a Logarithmic Function
Before working with graphs, we will take a look at the domain (the set of input values) for which the logarithmic function is defined.

Recall that the exponential function is defined as 

y=
b
x

 for any real number 

x

 and constant 

b>0,

 

b≠1,

 where
The domain of 

y

 is 

(

−∞,∞

).

 
The range of 

y

 is 

(

0,∞

).

 

In the last section we learned that the logarithmic function 

y=

log

b

(
x
)

 is the inverse of the exponential function 

y=
b
x

.

 So, as inverse functions:

The domain of 

y=

log

b

(
x
)

 is the range of 

y=
b
x

:

 

(

0,∞

).

 
The range of 

y=

log

b

(
x
)

 is the domain of 

y=
b
x

:

 

(

−∞,∞

).

 

Transformations of the parent function 

y=

log

b

(
x
)

 behave similarly to those of other functions. Just as with other parent functions, we can apply the four types of transformations—shifts, stretches, compressions, and reflections.

In Graphs of Exponential Functions we saw that certain transformations can change the range of 

y=
b
x

.

 Similarly, applying transformations to the parent function 

y=

log

b

(
x
)

 can change the domain. When finding the domain of a logarithmic function, therefore, it is important to remember that the domain consists only of positive real numbers. That is, the argument of the logarithmic function must be greater than zero.For example, consider 

f(x)=

log

4

(

2x−3

).

 This function is defined for any values of 

x

 such that the argument, in this case 

2x−3,

 is greater than zero. To find the domain, we set up an inequality and solve for 

x:

  
 
  
   
    
     
      2x−3>0
     
    
    
     
      Show the argument greater than zero.
     
    
   
   
    
     
      2x>3
     
    
    
     
      Add 3.
     
    
   
   
    
     
      x>1.5
       
        
         
        
        
         
        
        
         
        
        
         
        
       

      
     
    
    
     
      Divide by 2.
     
    
   

  
 

In interval notation, the domain of 

f(x)=

log

4

(

2x−3

)

 is 

(

1.5,∞

).

 

How To
Given a logarithmic function, identify the domain.

(x+3)?

 

The logarithmic function is defined only when the input is positive, so this function is defined when 

x+3>0.

 Solving this inequality,
 
 
  
   
    
     
      x+3>0
     
    
    
     
      The input must be positive.

What is the domain of 

f(x)=log(5−2x)?

 

The logarithmic function is defined only when the input is positive, so this function is defined when 

5–2x>0.

      5−2x>0

Graphing Logarithmic FunctionsNow that we have a feel for the set of values for which a logarithmic function is defined, we move on to graphing logarithmic functions. The family of logarithmic functions includes the parent function 

y=

log

b

(
x
)

 along with all its transformations: shifts, stretches, compressions, and reflections.

We begin with the parent function 

y=

log

b

(
x
).

 Because every logarithmic function of this form is the inverse of an exponential function with the form 

y=
b
x

,

 their graphs will be reflections of each other across the line 

y=x.

 To illustrate this, we can observe the relationship between the input and output values of 

y=
2
x

 and its equivalent

Graphing Transformations of Logarithmic Functions
As we mentioned in the beginning of the section, transformations of logarithmic graphs behave similarly to those of other parent functions. We can shift, stretch, compress, and reflect the parent function 

y=

log

b

(
x
)

 without loss of shape.

c

(x),

 the result is a horizontal shift

 units in the opposite direction of the sign on 

c.

 To visualize horizontal shifts, we can observe the general graph of the parent function

Graphing a Reflection of a Logarithmic Function
Sketch a graph of 

f(x)=log(−x)

 alongside its parent function. Include the key points and asymptote on the graph. State the domain, range, and asymptote.

Before graphing 

f(x)=log(−x),

 identify the behavior and key points for the graph.Since 

b=10

 is greater than one, we know that the parent function is increasing. Since the input value is multiplied by 

−1,

 

f

 is a reflection of the parent graph about the y-axis. Thus, 

f(x)=log(−x)

 will be decreasing as 

x

 moves from negative infinity to zero, and the right tail of the graph will approach the vertical asymptote 

x=0.

 
The x-intercept is 

(

How To
Given a logarithmic equation, use a graphing calculator to approximate solutions.
Press [Y=]. Enter the given logarithm equation or equations as Y1= and, if needed, Y2=.
Press [GRAPH] to observe the graphs of the curves and use [WINDOW] to find an appropriate view of the graphs, including their point(s) of intersection.
To find the value of 

x,

 we compute the point of intersection. Press [2ND] then [CALC]. Select “intersect” and press [ENTER] three times. The point of intersection gives the value of 

x,

 for the point(s) of intersection.

 next to Y1=. Then enter 

−2ln(

x−1

)

 next to Y2=. For a window, use the values 0 to 5 for 

x

 and –10 to 10 for 

y.

 Press [GRAPH]. The graphs should intersect somewhere a little to right of 

x=1.

 For a better approximation, press [2ND] then [CALC]. Select [5: intersect] and press [ENTER] three times. The x-coordinate of the point of intersection is displayed as 1.3385297. (Your answer may be different if you use a different window or use a different value for Guess?) So, to the nearest thousandth, 

x≈1.339.

Q&A
Is it possible to tell the domain and range and describe the end behavior of a function just by looking at the graph?
Yes, if we know the function is a general logarithmic function. For example, look at the graph in . The graph approaches 

x=−3

 (or thereabouts) more and more closely, so 

x=−3

 is, or is very close to, the vertical asymptote. It approaches from the right, so the domain is all points to the right, 

{x|x>−3}.

 The range, as with all general logarithmic functions, is all real numbers. And we can see the end behavior because the graph goes down as it goes left and up as it goes right. The end behavior is that as 

x→−
3
+

,f(x)→−∞

 and as 

x→∞,f(x)→∞.

Section Exercises
Verbal

The inverse of every logarithmic function is an exponential function and vice-versa. What does this tell us about the relationship between the coordinates of the points on the graphs of each?

 Since the functions are inverses, their graphs are mirror images about the line 

y=x.

 So for every point 

(a,b)

 on the graph of a logarithmic function, there is a corresponding point 

(b,a)

 on the graph of its inverse exponential function.

What type(s) of translation(s), if any, affect the range of a logarithmic function?

What type(s) of translation(s), if any, affect the domain of a logarithmic function?

Shifting the function right or left and reflecting the function about the y-axis will affect its domain.

Consider the general logarithmic function 

f(x)=

log

b

(
x
).

 Why can’t 

x

 be zero?

Does the graph of a general logarithmic function have a horizontal asymptote? Explain.

No. A horizontal asymptote would suggest a limit on the range, and the range of any logarithmic function in general form is all real numbers.

Extensions

Let 

b

 be any positive real number such that 

b≠1.

 and 

g(x)=−

)

 appear to be the same; Conjecture: for any positive base 

b≠1,

 

log

).

 

Prove the conjecture made in the previous exercise.

What is the domain of the function 

f(x)=ln(

x+2

x−4

)?

 Discuss the result.

Recall that the argument of a logarithmic function must be positive, so we determine where 

x+2

x−4

>0

 . From the graph of the function 

f(
x
)=

x+2

x−4

,

 note that the graph lies above the x-axis on the interval 

(

−∞,−2

)

 and again to the right of the vertical asymptote, that is 

(

4,∞

).

 Therefore, the domain is 

(

−∞,−2

)∪(

4,∞

).

 

Use properties of exponents to find the x-intercepts of the function 

f(x)=log(

x

+4x+4

)

 algebraically. Show the steps for solving, and then verify the result by graphing the function.
