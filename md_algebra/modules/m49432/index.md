Objective 1: Find the least common denominator of rational expressions (IA 7.2.3)A rational expression is an expression of the form pq where p and q are polynomials and q≠0 . 27,5y7xz2, x+1x+2, and 2x2+5x-7x2-9 are examples of rational expressions.Find the least common denominator of  the following rationals:

   23, 512, and 118 

  To find the LCD of the fractions, we factored 3, 12 and 18 into primes, lining up any common primes in columns. Then we “brought down” one prime from each column. Finally, we multiplied the factors to find the LCD.

 3=318=2*3*312=2*2*3LCD=2*2*3*3LCD=36

Partial Fraction DecompositionWhen we add rational expressions with unlike denominators such as 5x-3 and 2xx-2, we first need to find the LCD, then rewrite each fraction with the common denominator, and finally add the two numerators.
Find the sum of the two rational expressions.5x-3 and 2xx-2 

  
    Find the LCD of (x-3) and (x-2) 
    LCD = ________________
  
  
    Rewrite each rational as an equivalent rational expression with the LCD
     5x-3+2xx-2  5(x-2)(x-3)(x-2)+2x(        )(x-2)(x-3)5x-10(x-3)(x-2)+2x2-6x(x-2)(x-3) 
  
  
    Add the numerators and place the sum over the common denominator
     5x-10+2x2-6x(x-3)(x-2)2x2-11x-10(x-3)(x-2) 
  

We want to do the opposite now.
Given a rational expression like, 5x+6(x+4)(x+6) we would like to rewrite it as an addition of two simpler rational expressions A(x+4) and B(x+6) . Our goal is to find the values of A and B such that 5x+6(x+4)(x+6)=Ax+4+Bx+6

  
    Find the LCD of the denominators
     5x+6(x+4)(x+6)=Ax+4+Bx+6LCD is (x+)(x+6) 
  
  
    Multiply both sides of the equation by the LCD. Distribute and cancel like terms
     (x+4)(x+6)5x+6(x+4)(x+6)=Ax+4+Bx+6(x+4)(x+6)(x+4)(x+6)5x+6(x+4)(x+6)=Ax+4(x+4)(x+6)+Bx+6(x+4)(x+6)5x+16=A(x+6)+B(x+4) 
  
  
    On the right side, we expand and collect terms with like terms
     5x+16=A(x+6)+B(x+4)5x+16=Ax+6A+Bx+B5x+16=(A+B)x+(6A+4B) 
  
  
    We compare the coefficients of both sides. This will give a system of two equations with two variables
     5x+16=(A+B)x+(6A+4B)A+B=56A+4B=16 
  
  
    Use solving by elimination to find the values of A and B.
    
  
  
    Rewrite the original rational expression as the addition of two rational expressions with unlike denominators
    
  

Earlier in this chapter, we studied systems of two equations in two variables, systems of three equations in three variables, and nonlinear systems. Here we introduce another way that systems of equations can be utilized—the decomposition of rational expressions.
Fractions can be complicated; adding a variable in the denominator makes them even more so. The methods studied in this section will help simplify the concept of a rational expression.

Decomposing     P( x )   Q( x )      Where Q(x) Has Only Nonrepeated Linear FactorsRecall the algebra regarding adding and subtracting rational expressions. These operations depend on finding a common denominator so that we can write the sum or difference as a single, simplified rational expression. In this section, we will look at partial fraction decomposition, which is the undoing of the procedure to add or subtract rational expressions. In other words, it is a return from the single simplified rational expression to the original expressions, called the partial fraction.For example, suppose we add the following fractions:
 

2

x−3

+

−1

x+2

We would first need to find a common denominator, 

(x+2)(x−3).

Next, we would write each expression with this common denominator and find the sum of the terms.

          x−3
         
         
          x−3
         
        

       
      )=
     
    
   
   
    
     
                           
       
        2x+4−x+3
       
       
        (x+2)(x−3)
       
      
      =
       
        x+7

        −x−6
       
      

     
    
   

  
 
 Partial fraction decomposition is the reverse of this procedure. We would start with the solution and rewrite (decompose) it as the sum of two fractions.

Partialfractiondecomposition

We will investigate rational expressions with linear factors and quadratic factors in the denominator where the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator. Regardless of the type of expression we are decomposing, the first and most important thing to do is factor the denominator.
When the denominator of the simplified expression contains distinct linear factors, it is likely that each of the original rational expressions, which were added or subtracted, had one of the linear factors as the denominator. In other words, using the example above, the factors of 

x
2

−x−6

 are 

(

x−3

)(

x+2

),

 the denominators of the decomposed rational expression. So we will rewrite the simplified form as the sum of individual fractions and use a variable for each numerator. Then, we will solve for each numerator using one of several methods available for partial fraction decomposition.

Multiply both sides of the equation by the common denominator to eliminate fractions.

Set coefficients of like terms from the left side of the equation equal to those on the right side to create a system of equations to solve for the numerators.

)[

(

x+2

)

 ]+(

)

(

x−1

)

[ 

B

(

x−1

)

 ]

The resulting equation is
 

3x=A(

x−1

)+B(

x+2

)

Expand the right side of the equation and collect like terms.
 

3x=Ax−A+Bx+2B

3x=(A+B)x−A+2B

Set up a system of equations associating corresponding coefficients.
 

3=A+B

0=−A+2B

Add the two equations and solve for 

B.

 

3=A+B

0=−A+2B

¯

3=0+3B

1=B

 Substitute 

B=1

 into one of the original equations in the system.
 

3=A+1

2=A

Thus, the partial fraction decomposition is
 

3x

(

x+2

)(

x−1

)

=
2

(

x+2

)

+

(

x−1

)

Another method to use to solve for 

A

 or 

B

 is by considering the equation that resulted from eliminating the fractions and substituting a value for 

x

 that will make either the A- or B-term equal 0. If we let 

x=1,

 the 
 
A-
 
 term becomes 0 and we can simply solve for 

B.

 
 
  
   
    
     
           3x=A(x−1)+B(x+2)
     
    
   
   
    
     
       3(1)=A[(1)−1]+B[(1)+2]
     
    
   
   
    
     
             3=0+3B
     
    
   
   
    
     
             1=B
     
    
   

  
 

Next, either substitute 

B=1

 into the equation and solve for 

A,

 or make the B-term 0 by substituting 

x=−2

 into the equation. 
 
  
   
    
     
              3x=A(x−1)+B(x+2)
     
    
   
   
    
     
       3(−2)=A[(−2)−1]+B[(−2)+2]
     
    
   
   
    
     
            −6=−3A+0
     
    
   
   
    
     
            
       
        −6
       
       
        −3
       
      
      =A
     
    
   
   
    
     
                2=A
     
    
   

  
 

We obtain the same values for 

A

 and 

B

 using either method, so the decompositions are the same using either method.

Although this method is not seen very often in textbooks, we present it here as an alternative that may make some partial fraction decompositions easier. It is known as the Heaviside method, named after Charles Heaviside, a pioneer in the study of electronics.

   A,B,
  
  or 
  
   C
  
  representing constants. Now we will look at an example where one of the factors in the denominator is a quadratic expression that does not factor. This is referred to as an irreducible quadratic factor. In cases like this, we use a linear numerator such as 
  
   Ax+B,Bx+C,
  
  etc.

 The decomposition may contain more rational expressions if there are linear factors. Each linear factor will have a different constant numerator: 
  
   A,B,C,
  
  and so on.
How to feature
Given a rational expression where the factors of the denominator are distinct, irreducible quadratic factors, decompose it.
Use variables such as 
  
   A,B,
  
  or 
  
   C
  
  for the constant numerators over linear factors, and linear expressions such as 
  
   
    A

Multiply both sides of the equation by the common denominator to eliminate fractions.
Expand the right side of the equation and collect like terms.
Set coefficients of like terms from the left side of the equation equal to those on the right side to create a system of equations to solve for the numerators.

 We follow the same steps as in previous problems. First, clear the fractions by multiplying both sides of the equation by the common denominator.

Notice we could easily solve for 
  
   A
  
  by choosing a value for 
  
   x
  
  that will make the 
  
   Bx+C
  
  term equal 0. Let

  and substitute it into the equation.

Now that we know the value of 
  
   A,
  
  substitute it back into the equation. Then expand the right side and collect like terms.

   How to feature
   Given a rational expression that has a repeated irreducible factor, decompose it.
   Use variables like 
     
      A,B,
     
     or 
     
      C
     
     for the constant numerators over linear factors, and linear expressions such as 
     
      
       A
       1
      
      x+
       B
       1
      
      ,
       A
       2
      
      x+
       B
       2
      
      ,
     
     etc., for the numerators of each quadratic factor in the denominator written in increasing powers, such as
      
 
  
   
    P(x)
   
   
    Q(x)
   
  
  =
   A
   
    ax+b
   
  
  +
   
    
     A

    (a
     x
     2
    
    +bx+c)
   
  
  +
   
    
     A
     2
    
    x+
     B
     2
    

   
   
    
     
      (a
       x
       2
      
      +bx+c)
     
     2
    

   
  
  +⋯+
   
    
     A
     n
    
    +
     B
     n
    

   
   
    
     
      (a
       x
       2
      
      +bx+c)
     
     n
    

   
  

 

   Multiply both sides of the equation by the common denominator to eliminate fractions.
   Expand the right side of the equation and collect like terms.
   Set coefficients of like terms from the left side of the equation equal to those on the right side to create a system of equations to solve for the numerators.
  

  
     Decomposing a Rational Function with a Repeated Irreducible Quadratic Factor in the Denominator
     Decompose the given expression that has a repeated irreducible factor in the denominator.
      
      
       
        
         
          x
          4

         x
          
           (
            
             
              x
              2
             
             +1
            
            )
          
          2
         

        
       

      
     
     
    
    
     The factors of the denominator are 
      
       x,(
        x
        2
       
       +1),
      
      and 
      
       
        
         (
          x
          2
         
         +1)
        
        2
       
       .
      
      Recall that, when a factor in the denominator is a quadratic that includes at least two terms, the numerator must be of the linear form 
      
       Ax+B.
      
      So, let’s begin the decomposition.
      
      
       
        
         
          x

           (
            
             
              x
              2
             
             +1
            
            )
          
          2
         

        
       
       =
        A
        x
       
       +
        
         Bx+C
        
        
         (
          
           
            x
            2
           
           +1
          
          )
        
       
       +
        
         Dx+E
        
        
         
          
           (

            )
          
          2
         

        
       

      
     
     
     We eliminate the denominators by multiplying each term by 
      
       x
        
         (
          
           
            x

          )

Set up the system of equations matching corresponding coefficients on each side of the equal sign.
     
 
  
   
    
     
              A+B=1
     
    
   
   
    
     
                     C=1
     
    
   
   
    
     
      2A+B+D=1
     
    
   
   
    
     
              C+E=−1
     
    
   
   
    
     
                     A=1
     
    
   

  
 

We can use substitution from this point. Substitute  
 
A=1
 
 
 into the first equation.
     
 
  
   
    
     
      1+B=1
     
    
   
   
    
     
            B=0
     
    
   

  
 

Substitute  
 
A=1
 
 
 and  
 
B=0
 
 
 into the third equation.
     
 
  
   
    
     
      2(1)+0+D=1
     
    
   
   
    
     
                       D=−1
     
    
   

  
 

Substitute  
 
C=1
 
 
 into the fourth equation.
     
 
  
   
    
     
      1+E=−1
     
    
   
   
    
     
           E=−2
     
    
   

  
 

Now we have solved for all of the unknowns on the right side of the equal sign. We have  
 
A=1,
 
 
 
 
  B=0,
 
 
 
 
  C=1,
 
 
 
 
  D=−1,
 
 
 and  
 
E=−2.

Section ExercisesVerbal
Can any quotient of polynomials be decomposed into at least two partial fractions? If so, explain why, and if not, give an example of such a fraction
No, a quotient of polynomials can only be decomposed if the denominator can be factored. For example, 
 
   1
   
    
     x
     2
    
    +1
   
  

 
 cannot be decomposed because the denominator cannot be factored.

Can you explain why a partial fraction decomposition is unique? (Hint: Think about it as a system of equations.)

Can you explain how to verify a partial fraction decomposition graphically?
Graph both sides and ensure they are equal.

You are unsure if you correctly decomposed the partial fraction correctly. Explain how you could double-check your answer.

Once you have a system of equations generated by the partial fraction decomposition, can you explain another method to solve it? For example if you had 
 
   
    7x+13
   
   
    3
     x
     2
    
    +8x+15
   
  
  =
   A
   
    x+1
   
  
  +
   B
   
    3x+5
   
  
 
, we eventually simplify to 
 7x+13=A(3x+5)+B(x+1).
 
 Explain how you could intelligently choose an 
 x
 
 -value that will eliminate either 
 A
 
 or 
 B
 
 and solve for 
 A
 
 and 
 B.
 
 
If we choose 
 x=−1,
 
 then the B-term disappears, letting us immediately know that 
 A=3.
 
 We could alternatively plug in 
 x=−
   5
   3
  
 
, giving us a B-value of 
 −2.
