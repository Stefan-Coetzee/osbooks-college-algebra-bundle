Learning ObjectivesPlot points on a real number line (IA 1.4.7)
Plot points in a rectangular coordinate system (IA 3.1.1)

Objective 1:  Plot points on a real number line (IA 1.4.7)Locate Fractions and Decimals on the Number LineWe now want to include fractions and decimals on the number line. In this example we will locate and plot the following points: 15,−45,3,74,−92,−5 and 83
We’ll start with the whole numbers 3 and −5 because they are the easiest to plot. Use zero as your starting point, move to the right for positive numbers and to the left for negative numbers.The proper fractions listed are 15 and −45. We know the proper fraction 15 has value less than one and so would be located between 0 and 1. The denominator is 5, so imagine dividing the unit from 0 to 1 into 5 equal parts.Similarly, −45 is between 0 and −1. After dividing the unit into 5 equal parts we plot −45. Finally, look at the improper fractions 74,-92, and 83. Locating these points may be easier if you change each of them to a mixed number or use your calculator to get a decimal approximation.
The figure below shows the number line with all the points plotted.

Objective 2: Plot points in a rectangular coordinate system (IA 3.1.1)
Plot each point in the rectangular coordinate system and identify the quadrant in which the point is located:
ⓐ (−5,4) ⓑ (−3,−4) ⓒ (2,−3) ⓓ (0,−1) ⓔ (3,52).

The first number of the coordinate pair is the x-coordinate, and the second number is the y-coordinate. To plot each point, sketch a vertical line through the x-coordinate and a horizontal line through the y-coordinate. Their intersection is the point.
ⓐ Since x=−5, the point is to the left of the y-axis. Also, since y=4, the point is above the x-axis. The point (−5,4) is in Quadrant II.
ⓑ Since x=−3, the point is to the left of the y-axis. Also, since y=−4, the point is below the x-axis. The point (−3,−4) is in Quadrant III.
ⓒ Since x=2, the point is to the right of the y-axis. Since y=−3, the point is below the x-axis. The point (2,−3) is in Quadrant IV.
ⓓ Since x=0, the point whose coordinates are (0,−1) is on the y-axis.
ⓔ Since x=3, the point is to the right of the y-axis. Since y=52, the point is above the x-axis. (It may be helpful to write 52 as a mixed number or decimal.) The point (3,52) is in Quadrant I.

Tracie set out from Elmhurst, IL, to go to Franklin Park. On the way, she made a few stops to do errands. Each stop is indicated by a red dot in . Laying a rectangular coordinate grid over the map, we can see that each stop aligns with an intersection of grid lines. In this section, we will learn how to use grid lines to describe locations and changes in locations.
Plotting Ordered Pairs in the Cartesian Coordinate System

An old story describes how seventeenth-century philosopher/mathematician René Descartes, while sick in bed, invented the system that has become the foundation of algebra. According to the story, Descartes was staring at a fly crawling on the ceiling when he realized that he could describe the fly’s location in relation to the perpendicular lines formed by the adjacent walls of his room. He viewed the perpendicular lines as horizontal and vertical axes. Further, by dividing each axis into equal unit lengths, Descartes saw that it was possible to locate any object in a two-dimensional plane using just two numbers—the displacement from the horizontal axis and the displacement from the vertical axis.While there is evidence that ideas similar to Descartes’ grid system existed centuries earlier, it was Descartes who introduced the components that comprise the Cartesian coordinate system, a grid system having perpendicular axes. Descartes named the horizontal axis the x-axis and the vertical axis the y-axis.The Cartesian coordinate system, also called the rectangular coordinate system, is based on a two-dimensional plane consisting of the x-axis and the y-axis. Perpendicular to each other, the axes divide the plane into four sections. Each section is called a quadrant; the quadrants are numbered counterclockwise as shown in 

The center of the plane is the point at which the two axes cross. It is known as the origin, or point 
 
  (0,0).
 
 From the origin, each axis is further divided into equal units: increasing, positive numbers to the right on the x-axis and up the y-axis; decreasing, negative numbers to the left on the x-axis and down the y-axis. The axes extend to positive and negative infinity as shown by the arrowheads in .

Each point in the plane is identified by its x-coordinate, or horizontal displacement from the origin, and its y-coordinate, or vertical displacement from the origin. Together, we write them as an ordered pair indicating the combined distance from the origin in the form 
 
(
   
    x,y
   
  ). 
 An ordered pair is also known as a coordinate pair because it consists of x- and y-coordinates. For example, we can represent the point 
 
(3,−1) 
 in the plane by moving three units to the right of the origin in the horizontal direction, and one unit down in the vertical direction. See .

When dividing the axes into equally spaced increments, note that the x-axis may be considered separately from the y-axis. In other words, while the x-axis may be divided and labeled according to consecutive integers, the y-axis may be divided and labeled by increments of 2, or 10, or 100. In fact, the axes may represent other units, such as years against the balance in a savings account, or quantity against cost, and so on. Consider the rectangular coordinate system primarily as a method for showing the relationship between two quantities.

Cartesian Coordinate System
A two-dimensional plane where the
x-axis is the horizontal axis
y-axis is the vertical axis A point in the plane is defined as an ordered pair, 
 
(
   
    x,y
   
  ),
 
 such that x is determined by its horizontal distance from the origin and y is determined by its vertical distance from the origin.

Plotting Points in a Rectangular Coordinate System
Plot the points 
 
(
   
    −2,4
   
  ),
 
 
 
  (
   
    3,3
   
  ),
 
 and 
 
(
   
    0,−3
   
  ) 
 in the plane.

To plot the point 
 
(
   
    −2,4
   
  ),
 
 begin at the origin. The x-coordinate is –2, so move two units to the left. The y-coordinate is 4, so then move four units up in the positive y direction.To plot the point 
 
(
   
    3,3
   
  ),
 
 begin again at the origin. The x-coordinate is 3, so move three units to the right. The y-coordinate is also 3, so move three units up in the positive y direction.
To plot the point 
 
(
   
    0,−3
   
  ),
 
 begin again at the origin. The x-coordinate is 0. This tells us not to move in either direction along the x-axis. The y-coordinate is –3, so move three units down in the negative y direction. See the graph in .

Analysis
Note that when either coordinate is zero, the point must be on an axis. If the x-coordinate is zero, the point is on the y-axis. If the y-coordinate is zero, the point is on the x-axis.

Graphing Equations by Plotting PointsWe can plot a set of points to represent an equation. When such an equation contains both an x variable and a y variable, it is called an equation in two variables. Its graph is called a graph in two variables. Any graph on a two-dimensional plane is a graph in two variables.
Suppose we want to graph the equation 
 
y=2x−1.
 We can begin by substituting a value for x into the equation and determining the resulting value of y. Each pair of x- and y-values is an ordered pair that can be plotted.  lists values of x from –3 to 3 and the resulting values for y.

We can plot the points in the table. The points for this particular equation form a line, so we can connect them. See . This is not true for all equations.

Note that the x-values chosen are arbitrary, regardless of the type of equation we are graphing. Of course, some situations may require particular values of x to be plotted in order to see a particular result. Otherwise, it is logical to choose values that can be calculated easily, and it is always a good idea to choose values that are both negative and positive. There is no rule dictating how many points to plot, although we need at least two to graph a line. Keep in mind, however, that the more points we plot, the more accurately we can sketch the graph.

How To
Given an equation, graph by plotting points.

Make a table with one column labeled x, a second column labeled with the equation, and a third column listing the resulting ordered pairs.
Enter x-values down the first column using positive and negative values. Selecting the x-values in numerical order will make the graphing simpler.
Select x-values that will yield y-values with little effort, preferably ones that can be calculated mentally.
Plot the ordered pairs.
Connect the points if they form a line.

Graphing Equations with a Graphing UtilityMost graphing calculators require similar techniques to graph an equation. The equations sometimes have to be manipulated so they are written in the style 
 
y=_____. 
 The TI-84 Plus, and many other calculator makes and models, have a mode function, which allows the window (the screen for viewing the graph) to be altered so the pertinent parts of a graph can be seen.
For example, the equation 
 
y=2x−20 
 has been entered in the TI-84 Plus shown in a. In b, the resulting graph is shown. Notice that we cannot see on the screen where the graph crosses the axes. The standard window screen on the TI-84 Plus shows 
 
−10≤x≤10,
 
 and 
 
−10≤y≤10. 
 See c.

a. Enter the equation. b. This is the graph in the original window. c. These are the original settings.By changing the window to show more of the positive x-axis and more of the negative y-axis, we have a much better view of the graph and the x- and y-intercepts. See a and b.

a. This screen shows the new window settings. b. We can clearly view the intercepts in the new window.

Enter the equation in the y= function of the calculator. Set the window settings so that both the x- and y- intercepts are showing in the window. See .

Finding x-intercepts and y-intercepts
The intercepts of a graph are points at which the graph crosses the axes. The x-intercept is the point at which the graph crosses the x-axis. At this point, the y-coordinate is zero. The y-intercept is the point at which the graph crosses the y-axis. At this point, the x-coordinate is zero.
To determine the x-intercept, we set y equal to zero and solve for x. Similarly, to determine the y-intercept, we set x equal to zero and solve for y. For example, lets find the intercepts of the equation 
 
y=3x−1.
 To find the x-intercept, set 
 
y=0.
 
 

 
  
   
    
     
      y=3x−1

To find the y-intercept, set

  ,
 
 is based on a right triangle where a and b are the lengths of the legs adjacent to the right angle, and c is the length of the hypotenuse. See .

Finding the Distance between Two Locations
Let’s return to the situation introduced at the beginning of this section.Tracie set out from Elmhurst, IL, to go to Franklin Park. On the way, she made a few stops to do errands. Each stop is indicated by a red dot in . Find the total distance that Tracie traveled. Compare this with the distance between her starting and final positions.

The first thing we should do is identify ordered pairs to describe each position. If we set the starting position at the origin, we can identify each of the other points by counting units east (right) and north (up) on the grid. For example, the first stop is 1 block east and 1 block north, so it is at 
 
(
   
    1,1
   
  ). 
 The next stop is 5 blocks to the east, so it is at 
 
(
   
    5,1
   
  ). 
 After that, she traveled 3 blocks east and 2 blocks north to 
 
(
   
    8,3
   
  ). 
 Lastly, she traveled 4 blocks north to 
 
(
   
    8,7
   
  ). 
 We can label these points on the grid as in .

Next, we can calculate the distance. Note that each grid unit represents 1,000 feet.
From her starting location to her first stop at 
 
(
   
    1,1
   
  ),
 
 Tracie might have driven north 1,000 feet and then east 1,000 feet, or vice versa. Either way, she drove 2,000 feet to her first stop.
Her second stop is at 
 
(
   
    5,1
   
  ). 
 So from 
 
(
   
    1,1
   
  ) 
 to 
 
(
   
    5,1
   
  ),
 
 Tracie drove east 4,000 feet.
Her third stop is at 
 
(
   
    8,3
   
  ). 
 There are a number of routes from 
 
(
   
    5,1
   
  ) 
 to 
 
(
   
    8,3
   
  ). 
 Whatever route Tracie decided to use, the distance is the same, as there are no angular streets between the two points. Let’s say she drove east 3,000 feet and then north 2,000 feet for a total of 5,000 feet.
Tracie’s final stop is at 
 
(
   
    8,7
   
  ). 
 This is a straight drive north from 
 
(
   
    8,3
   
  ) 
 for a total of 4,000 feet. Next, we will add the distances listed in .

The total distance Tracie drove is 15,000 feet, or 2.84 miles. This is not, however, the actual distance between her starting and ending positions. To find this distance, we can use the distance formula between the points 
 
(
   
    0,0
   
  ) 
 and 
 
(
   
    8,7

      ≈10.63units
     
    
   

  
 
 At 1,000 feet per grid unit, the distance between Elmhurst, IL, to Franklin Park is 10,630.14 feet, or 2.01 miles. The distance formula results in a shorter calculation because it is based on the hypotenuse of a right triangle, a straight diagonal from the origin to the point 
 
(
   
    8,7
   
  ). 
 Perhaps you have heard the saying “as the crow flies,” which means the shortest distance between two points because a crow can fly in a straight line even though a person on the ground has to travel a longer distance on existing roadways.

Using the Midpoint Formula
When the endpoints of a line segment are known, we can find the point midway between them. This point is known as the midpoint and the formula is known as the midpoint formula. Given the endpoints of a line segment,

M.

Technology
For the following exercises, use your graphing calculator to input the linear graphs in the Y= graph menu.
After graphing it, use the 2nd CALC button and 1:value button, hit enter. At the lower part of the screen you will see “x=” and a blinking cursor. You may enter any number for x and it will display the y value for any x value you input. Use this and plug in x = 0, thus finding the y-intercept, for each of the following graphs.

For the following exercises, use your graphing calculator to input the linear graphs in the Y= graph menu.
After graphing it, use the 2nd CALC button and 2:zero button, hit ENTER. At the lower part of the screen you will see “left bound?” and a blinking cursor on the graph of the line. Move this cursor to the left of the x-intercept, hit ENTER. Now it says “right bound?” Move the cursor to the right of the x-intercept, hit ENTER. Now it says “guess?” Move your cursor to the left somewhere in between the left and right bound near the x-intercept. Hit ENTER. At the bottom of your screen it will display the coordinates of the x-intercept or the “zero” to the y-value. Use this to find the x-intercept.Note: With linear/straight line functions the zero is not really a “guess,” but it is necessary to enter a “guess” so it will search and find the exact x-intercept between your right and left boundaries. With other types of functions (more than one x-intercept), they may be irrational numbers so “guess” is more appropriate to give it the correct limits to find a very close approximation between the left and right boundaries.

Extensions
Someone drove 10 mi directly east from their home, made a left turn at an intersection, and then traveled 5 mi north to their place of work. If a road was made directly from the home to the place of work, what would its distance be to the nearest tenth of a mile?
If the road was made in the previous exercise, how much shorter would the person’s one-way trip be every day?

Given the graph of the rectangle shown and the coordinates of its vertices, prove that the diagonals of the rectangle are of equal length.

  
 

In the previous exercise, find the coordinates of the midpoint for each diagonal.
Midpoint of each diagonal is the same point (2,2). Note this is a characteristic of rectangles, but not other quadrilaterals.

Real-World Applications
The coordinates on a map for San Francisco are (53,17) and those for Sacramento are (128,78). Note that coordinates represent miles. Find the distance between the cities to the nearest mile.
If San Jose’s coordinates are (76,–12), where the coordinates represent miles, find the distance between San Jose and San Francisco to the nearest mile.
