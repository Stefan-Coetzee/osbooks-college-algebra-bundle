**Locate Fractions and Decimals on the Number Line**

We now want to include fractions and decimals on the number line. 
In this example we will locate and plot the following points: $\frac{1}{5},-\frac{4}{5},3,\frac{7}{4},-\frac{9}{2},\mathrm{-5}$ and $\frac{8}{3}$

We’ll start with the whole numbers 3 and $\mathrm{-5}$ because they are the easiest to plot. Use zero as your starting point, move to the right for positive numbers and to the left for negative numbers.
The proper fractions listed are $\frac{1}{5}$ and $-\frac{4}{5}.$ We know the proper fraction $\frac{1}{5}$ has value less than one and so would be located between 0 and 1. The denominator is 5, so imagine dividing the unit from 0 to 1 into 5 equal parts.
Similarly, $-\frac{4}{5}$ is between 0 and $\mathrm{-1}.$ After dividing the unit into 5 equal parts we plot $-\frac{4}{5}.$ 
Finally, look at the improper fractions $\frac{7}{4},-\frac{9}{2}$, and $\frac{8}{3}.$ Locating these points may be easier if you change each of them to a mixed number or use your calculator to get a decimal approximation.

The figure below shows the number line with all the points plotted.

![Figure shows a number line with numbers ranging from minus 6 to 6. Various points on the line are highlighted. From left to right, these are: minus 5, minus 9 by 2, minus 4 by 5, 1 by 5, 4 by 5, 8 by 3 and 3.](../../media/IntAlg_Figure_01_04_017_img_new.jpg)

The first number of the coordinate pair is the *x*-coordinate, and the second number is the *y*-coordinate. To plot each point, sketch a vertical line through the *x*-coordinate and a horizontal line through the *y*-coordinate. Their intersection is the point.
ⓐ Since $x=\mathrm{-5},$ the point is to the left of the *y*-axis. Also, since $y=4,$ the point is above the *x*-axis. The point $\left(\mathrm{-5},4\right)$ is in Quadrant II.
ⓑ Since $x=\mathrm{-3},$ the point is to the left of the *y*-axis. Also, since $y=\mathrm{-4},$ the point is below the *x*-axis. The point $\left(\mathrm{-3},\mathrm{-4}\right)$ is in Quadrant III.
ⓒ Since $x=2,$ the point is to the right of the *y*-axis. Since $y=\mathrm{-3},$ the point is below the *x*-axis. The point $\left(2,\mathrm{-3}\right)$ is in Quadrant IV.
ⓓ Since $x=0,$ the point whose coordinates are $\left(0,\mathrm{-1}\right)$ is on the *y*-axis.
ⓔ Since $x=3,$ the point is to the right of the *y*-axis. Since $y=\frac{5}{2},$ the point is above the *x*-axis. (It may be helpful to write $\frac{5}{2}$ as a mixed number or decimal.) The point $\left(3,\frac{5}{2}\right)$ is in Quadrant I.

Tracie set out from Elmhurst, IL, to go to Franklin Park. On the way, she made a few stops to do errands. Each stop is indicated by a red dot in . Laying a rectangular coordinate grid over the map, we can see that each stop aligns with an intersection of grid lines. In this section, we will learn how to use grid lines to describe locations and changes in locations.

# Plotting Ordered Pairs in the Cartesian Coordinate System
An old story describes how seventeenth-century philosopher/mathematician René Descartes, while sick in bed, invented the system that has become the foundation of algebra. According to the story, Descartes was staring at a fly crawling on the ceiling when he realized that he could describe the fly’s location in relation to the perpendicular lines formed by the adjacent walls of his room. He viewed the perpendicular lines as horizontal and vertical axes. Further, by dividing each axis into equal unit lengths, Descartes saw that it was possible to locate any object in a two-dimensional plane using just two numbers—the displacement from the horizontal axis and the displacement from the vertical axis.
While there is evidence that ideas similar to Descartes’ grid system existed centuries earlier, it was Descartes who introduced the components that comprise the **Cartesian coordinate system**, a grid system having perpendicular axes. Descartes named the horizontal axis the ***x-*axis** and the vertical axis the ***y-*axis**.
The Cartesian coordinate system, also called the rectangular coordinate system, is based on a two-dimensional plane consisting of the *x*-axis and the *y*-axis. Perpendicular to each other, the axes divide the plane into four sections. Each section is called a **quadrant**; the quadrants are numbered counterclockwise as shown in 

![Image](../../media/CNX_CAT_Figure_02_01_002.jpg)

The center of the plane is the point at which the two axes cross. It is known as the **origin**, or point $(0,0).$ From the origin, each axis is further divided into equal units: increasing, positive numbers to the right on the *x-*axis and up the *y-*axis; decreasing, negative numbers to the left on the *x-*axis and down the *y-*axis. The axes extend to positive and negative infinity as shown by the arrowheads in .

![Image](../../media/CNX_CAT_Figure_02_01_003.jpg)

Each point in the plane is identified by its ***x-*coordinate**, or horizontal displacement from the origin, and its ***y-*coordinate**, or vertical displacement from the origin. Together, we write them as an **ordered pair** indicating the combined distance from the origin in the form $\left(x,y\right).$ An ordered pair is also known as a coordinate pair because it consists of *x-* and *y*-coordinates. For example, we can represent the point $(3,\mathrm{-1})$ in the plane by moving three units to the right of the origin in the horizontal direction, and one unit down in the vertical direction. See .

![Image](../../media/CNX_CAT_Figure_02_01_004.jpg)

When dividing the axes into equally spaced increments, note that the *x-*axis may be considered separately from the *y-*axis. In other words, while the *x-*axis may be divided and labeled according to consecutive integers, the *y-*axis may be divided and labeled by increments of 2, or 10, or 100. In fact, the axes may represent other units, such as years against the balance in a savings account, or quantity against cost, and so on. Consider the rectangular coordinate system primarily as a method for showing the relationship between two quantities.

9. **Plotting Points in a Rectangular Coordinate System**   Plot the points $\left(\mathrm{-2},4\right),$ $\left(3,3\right),$ and $\left(0,\mathrm{-3}\right)$ in the plane.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

To plot the point $\left(\mathrm{-2},4\right),$ begin at the origin. The *x*-coordinate is –2, so move two units to the left. The *y*-coordinate is 4, so then move four units up in the positive *y*direction.
To plot the point $\left(3,3\right),$ begin again at the origin. The *x*-coordinate is 3, so move three units to the right. The *y*-coordinate is also 3, so move three units up in the positive *y*direction.

To plot the point $\left(0,\mathrm{-3}\right),$ begin again at the origin. The *x*-coordinate is 0. This tells us not to move in either direction along the *x*-axis. The *y*-coordinate is –3, so move three units down in the negative *y* direction. See the graph in .

# Graphing Equations by Plotting Points
We can plot a set of points to represent an equation. When such an equation contains both an *x*variable and a *y*variable, it is called an **equation in two variables**. Its graph is called a **graph in two variables**. Any graph on a two-dimensional plane is a graph in two variables.
Suppose we want to graph the equation $y=2x-1.$ We can begin by substituting a value for *x* into the equation and determining the resulting value of *y*. Each pair of *x*- and *y*-values is an ordered pair that can be plotted.  lists values of *x* from –3 to 3 and the resulting values for *y*.

| $x$ | $y=2x-1$ | $\left(x,y\right)$ |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $\mathrm{-3}$ | $y=2(\mathrm{-3})-1=\mathrm{-7}$ | $\left(\mathrm{-3},\mathrm{-7}\right)$ |
| $\mathrm{-2}$ | $y=2(\mathrm{-2})-1=\mathrm{-5}$ | $\left(\mathrm{-2},\mathrm{-5}\right)$ |
| $\mathrm{-1}$ | $y=2(\mathrm{-1})-1=\mathrm{-3}$ | $\left(\mathrm{-1},\mathrm{-3}\right)$ |
| $0$ | $y=2(0)-1=\mathrm{-1}$ | $\left(0,\mathrm{-1}\right)$ |
| $1$ | $y=2(1)-1=1$ | $\left(1,1\right)$ |
| $2$ | $y=2(2)-1=3$ | $\left(2,3\right)$ |
| $3$ | $y=2(3)-1=5$ | $\left(3,5\right)$ |

We can plot the points in the table. The points for this particular equation form a line, so we can connect them. See *.*This is not true for all equations.

![Image](../../media/CNX_CAT_Figure_02_01_006.jpg)

Note that the *x-*values chosen are arbitrary, regardless of the type of equation we are graphing. Of course, some situations may require particular values of *x* to be plotted in order to see a particular result. Otherwise, it is logical to choose values that can be calculated easily, and it is always a good idea to choose values that are both negative and positive. There is no rule dictating how many points to plot, although we need at least two to graph a line. Keep in mind, however, that the more points we plot, the more accurately we can sketch the graph.

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $\mathrm{-5}$ | $y=-\left(\mathrm{-5}\right)+2=7$ | $\left(\mathrm{-5},7\right)$ |
| $\mathrm{-3}$ | $y=-\left(\mathrm{-3}\right)+2=5$ | $\left(\mathrm{-3},5\right)$ |

# Graphing Equations with a Graphing Utility
Most graphing calculators require similar techniques to graph an equation. The equations sometimes have to be manipulated so they are written in the style $y=\_\_\_\_\_.$ The TI-84 Plus, and many other calculator makes and models, have a mode function, which allows the window (the screen for viewing the graph) to be altered so the pertinent parts of a graph can be seen.
For example, the equation $y=2x-20$ has been entered in the TI-84 Plus shown in *a.*In *b,*the resulting graph is shown. Notice that we cannot see on the screen where the graph crosses the axes. The standard window screen on the TI-84 Plus shows $\mathrm{-10}\le x\le 10,$ and $\mathrm{-10}\le y\le 10.$ See *c*.

![a. Enter the equation. b. This is the graph in the original window. c. These are the original settings.](../../media/CNX_CAT_Figure_02_01_009abcN.jpg)

By changing the window to show more of the positive *x-*axis and more of the negative *y-*axis, we have a much better view of the graph and the *x-* and *y-*intercepts. See *a* and *b.*

# Finding *x-*intercepts and *y-*intercepts
The **intercepts** of a graph are points at which the graph crosses the axes. The ***x-*intercept** is the point at which the graph crosses the *x-*axis. At this point, the *y-*coordinate is zero. The ***y-*intercept** is the point at which the graph crosses the *y-*axis. At this point, the *x-*coordinate is zero.
To determine the *x-*intercept, we set *y*equal to zero and solve for *x*. Similarly, to determine the *y-*intercept, we set *x*equal to zero and solve for *y*. For example, lets find the intercepts of the equation $y=3x-1.$ 
To find the *x-*intercept, set $y=0.$ 
$$
\begin{array}{ll}\phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}y=3x-1  &   \\ \phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}0=3x-1  &   \\ \phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}1=3x  &   \\ \frac{1}{3}=x  &   \\ \left(\frac{1}{3},0\right)  & x\text{\u2212intercept}  \end{array}
$$
To find the *y-*intercept, set $x=0.$ 
$$
\begin{array}{l}y=3x-1  \\ y=3(0)-1  \\ y=\mathrm{-1}  \\ (0,\mathrm{-1})\phantom{\rule{3em}{0ex}}y\text{\u2212intercept}  \end{array}
$$ We can confirm that our results make sense by observing a graph of the equation as in . Notice that the graph crosses the axes where we predicted it would.

# Using the Distance Formula
Derived from the **Pythagorean Theorem**, the **distance formula** is used to find the distance between two points in the plane. The Pythagorean Theorem, ${a}^{2}+{b}^{2}={c}^{2},$ is based on a right triangle where *a*and *b* are the lengths of the legs adjacent to the right angle, and *c* is the length of the hypotenuse. See .

![Image](../../media/CNX_CAT_Figure_02_01_015.jpg)

The relationship of sides $\left|{x}_{2}-{x}_{1}\right|$ and $\left|{y}_{2}-{y}_{1}\right|$ to side *d* is the same as that of sides *a*and *b*to side *c.* We use the absolute value symbol to indicate that the length is a positive number because the absolute value of any number is positive. (For example, $\left|\mathrm{-3}\right|=3.$ ) The symbols $\left|{x}_{2}-{x}_{1}\right|$ and $\left|{y}_{2}-{y}_{1}\right|$ indicate that the lengths of the sides of the triangle are positive. To find the length *c*, take the square root of both sides of the Pythagorean Theorem.
$$
{c}^{2}={a}^{2}+{b}^{2}\to c=\sqrt{{a}^{2}+{b}^{2}}
$$
It follows that the distance formula is given as
${d}^{2}={({x}_{2}-{x}_{1})}^{2}+{({y}_{2}-{y}_{1})}^{2}\to d=\sqrt{{({x}_{2}-{x}_{1})}^{2}+{({y}_{2}-{y}_{1})}^{2}}$
We do not have to use the absolute value symbols in this definition because any number squared is positive.

17. **Finding the Distance between Two Locations**   Let’s return to the situation introduced at the beginning of this section. Tracie set out from Elmhurst, IL, to go to Franklin Park. On the way, she made a few stops to do errands. Each stop is indicated by a red dot in . Find the total distance that Tracie traveled. Compare this with the distance between her starting and final positions.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

The first thing we should do is identify ordered pairs to describe each position. If we set the starting position at the origin, we can identify each of the other points by counting units east (right) and north (up) on the grid. For example, the first stop is 1 block east and 1 block north, so it is at $\left(1,1\right).$ The next stop is 5 blocks to the east, so it is at $\left(5,1\right).$ After that, she traveled 3 blocks east and 2 blocks north to $\left(8,3\right).$ Lastly, she traveled 4 blocks north to $\left(8,7\right).$ We can label these points on the grid as in .

![Image](../../media/CNX_CAT_Figure_02_01_017.jpg)

Next, we can calculate the distance. Note that each grid unit represents 1,000 feet.

From her starting location to her first stop at $\left(1,1\right),$ Tracie might have driven north 1,000 feet and then east 1,000 feet, or vice versa. Either way, she drove 2,000 feet to her first stop.
Her second stop is at $\left(5,1\right).$ So from $\left(1,1\right)$ to $\left(5,1\right),$ Tracie drove east 4,000 feet.
Her third stop is at $\left(8,3\right).$ There are a number of routes from $\left(5,1\right)$ to $\left(8,3\right).$ Whatever route Tracie decided to use, the distance is the same, as there are no angular streets between the two points. Let’s say she drove east 3,000 feet and then north 2,000 feet for a total of 5,000 feet.
Tracie’s final stop is at $\left(8,7\right).$ This is a straight drive north from $\left(8,3\right)$ for a total of 4,000 feet. Next, we will add the distances listed in .

| From/To | Number of Feet Driven |
| :--- | :--- |
| $\left(0,0\right)$ to $\left(1,1\right)$ | 2,000 |
| $\left(1,1\right)$ to $\left(5,1\right)$ | 4,000 |
| $\left(5,1\right)$ to $\left(8,3\right)$ | 5,000 |
| $\left(8,3\right)$ to $\left(8,7\right)$ | 4,000 |
| Total | 15,000 |

The total distance Tracie drove is 15,000 feet, or 2.84 miles. This is not, however, the actual distance between her starting and ending positions. To find this distance, we can use the distance formula between the points $\left(0,0\right)$ and $\left(8,7\right).$

$$ At 1,000 feet per grid unit, the distance between Elmhurst, IL, to Franklin Park is 10,630.14 feet, or 2.01 miles. The distance formula results in a shorter calculation because it is based on the hypotenuse of a right triangle, a straight diagonal from the origin to the point $\left(8,7\right).$ Perhaps you have heard the saying “as the crow flies,” which means the shortest distance between two points because a crow can fly in a straight line even though a person on the ground has to travel a longer distance on existing roadways.

# Using the Midpoint Formula
When the endpoints of a line segment are known, we can find the point midway between them. This point is known as the midpoint and the formula is known as the **midpoint formula**. Given the endpoints of a line segment, $\left({x}_{1},{y}_{1}\right)$ and $\left({x}_{2},{y}_{2}\right),$ the midpoint formula states how to find the coordinates of the midpoint $M.$ 
$$
M=\left(\frac{{x}_{1}+{x}_{2}}{2},\frac{{y}_{1}+{y}_{2}}{2}\right)
$$ A graphical view of a midpoint is shown in . Notice that the line segments on either side of the midpoint are congruent.

20. **Finding the Center of a Circle**   The diameter of a circle has endpoints $\left(\mathrm{-1},\mathrm{-4}\right)$ and $\left(5,\mathrm{-4}\right).$ Find the center of the circle.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

The center of a circle is the center, or midpoint, of its diameter. Thus, the midpoint formula will yield the center point.

$$
\begin{array}{c}\left(\frac{{x}_{1}+{x}_{2}}{2},\frac{{y}_{1}+{y}_{2}}{2}\right)\\ \left(\frac{-1+5}{2},\frac{-4-4}{2}\right)=\left(\frac{4}{2},-\frac{8}{2}\right)=(2,\mathrm{-4})\end{array}

# Key Concepts

We can locate, or plot, points in the Cartesian coordinate system using ordered pairs, which are defined as displacement from the *x-*axis and displacement from the *y-*axis. See .
An equation can be graphed in the plane by creating a table of values and plotting points. See *.*
Using a graphing calculator or a computer program makes graphing equations faster and more accurate. Equations usually have to be entered in the form *y=*_____. See *.*
Finding the *x-*and *y-*intercepts can define the graph of a line. These are the points where the graph crosses the axes. See .
The distance formula is derived from the Pythagorean Theorem and is used to find the length of a line segment. See  and .
The midpoint formula provides a method of finding the coordinates of the midpoint dividing the sum of the *x*-coordinates and the sum of the *y*-coordinates of the endpoints by 2. See  and .

50. ${\text{Y}}_{1}=\frac{x+5}{2}$

For the following exercises, use your graphing calculator to input the linear graphs in the Y= graph menu.
After graphing it, use the 2nd *CALC* button and 2:zero button, hit *ENTER*. At the lower part of the screen you will see “left bound?” and a blinking cursor on the graph of the line. Move this cursor to the left of the *x*-intercept, hit *ENTER*. Now it says “right bound?” Move the cursor to the right of the *x*-intercept, hit *ENTER*. Now it says “guess?” Move your cursor to the left somewhere in between the left and right bound near the *x*-intercept. Hit *ENTER*. At the bottom of your screen it will display the coordinates of the *x-*intercept or the “zero” to the *y*-value. Use this to find the *x*-intercept.
Note: With linear/straight line functions the zero is not really a “guess,” but it is necessary to enter a “guess” so it will search and find the exact *x*-intercept between your right and left boundaries. With other types of functions (more than one *x*-intercept), they may be irrational numbers so “guess” is more appropriate to give it the correct limits to find a very close approximation between the left and right boundaries.
