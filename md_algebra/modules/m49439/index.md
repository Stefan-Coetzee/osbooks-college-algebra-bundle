Objective 2: Graph a hyperbola with center at (0,0). (IA 11.4.1)A hyperbola is all points in a plane where the difference of their distances from two fixed points is constant. Each of the fixed points is called a focus of the hyperbola.The line through the foci is called the transverse axis. The two points where the transverse axis intersects the hyperbola are each a vertex of the hyperbola. The midpoint of the segment joining the foci is called the center of the hyperbola. The line perpendicular to the transverse axis that passes through the center is called the conjugate axis. Each piece of the graph is called a branch of the hyperbola.

Notice that, unlike the equation of an ellipse, the denominator of x2 is not always a2 and the denominator of y2 is not always b2 . Notice that when the x2 term is positive, the transverse axis is on the x-axis. When the y2 term is positive, the transverse axis is on the y-axis.

What do paths of comets, supersonic booms, ancient Grecian pillars, and natural draft cooling towers have in common? They can all be modeled by the same type of conic. For instance, when something moves faster than the speed of sound, a shock wave in the form of a cone is created. A portion of a conic is formed when the wave intersects the ground, resulting in a sonic boom. See .

A shock wave intersecting the ground forms a portion of a conic and results in a sonic boom.

Most people are familiar with the sonic boom created by supersonic aircraft, but humans were breaking the sound barrier long before the first supersonic flight. The crack of a whip occurs because the tip is exceeding the speed of sound. The bullets shot from many firearms also break the sound barrier, although the bang of the gun usually supersedes the sound of the sonic boom.
Locating the Vertices and Foci  of a HyperbolaIn analytic geometry, a hyperbola is a conic section formed by intersecting a right circular cone with a plane at an angle such that both halves of the cone are intersected. This intersection produces two separate unbounded curves that are mirror images of each other. See .

A hyperbola

Like the ellipse, the hyperbola can also be defined as a set of points in the coordinate plane. A hyperbola is the set of all points 
 
  (
   
    x,y
   
  )
 
 in a plane such that the difference of the distances between 
 
  (
   
    x,y
   
  )
 
 and the foci is a positive constant.Notice that the definition of a hyperbola is very similar to that of an ellipse. The distinction is that the hyperbola is defined in terms of the difference of two distances, whereas the ellipse is defined in terms of the sum of two distances.As with the ellipse, every hyperbola has two axes of symmetry. The transverse axis is a line segment that passes through the center of the hyperbola and has vertices as its endpoints. The foci lie on the line that contains the transverse axis. The conjugate axis is perpendicular to the transverse axis and has the co-vertices as its endpoints. The center of a hyperbola is the midpoint of both the transverse and conjugate axes, where they intersect. Every hyperbola also has two asymptotes that pass through its center. As a hyperbola recedes from the center, its branches approach these asymptotes. The central rectangle of the hyperbola is centered at the origin with sides that pass through each vertex and co-vertex; it is a useful tool for graphing the hyperbola and its asymptotes. To sketch the asymptotes of the hyperbola, simply sketch and extend the diagonals of the central rectangle. See .

Key features of the hyperbola

In this section, we will limit our discussion to hyperbolas that are positioned vertically or horizontally in the coordinate plane; the axes will either lie on or be parallel to the x- and y-axes. We will consider two cases: those that are centered at the origin, and those that are centered at a point other than the origin.
Deriving the Equation of a Hyperbola Centered at the OriginLet 
 
  (
   
    −c,0
   
  )
 
 and 
 
  (
   
    c,0
   
  )
 
 be the foci of a hyperbola centered at the origin. The hyperbola is the set of all points 
 
  (
   
    x,y
   
  )
 
 such that the difference of the distances from 
 
  (
   
    x,y
   
  )
 
 to the foci is constant. See .

If 
 
  (
   
    a,0
   
  )
 
 is a vertex of the hyperbola, the distance from 
 
  (
   
    −c,0
   
  )
 
 to 
 
  (
   
    a,0
   
  )
 
 is 
 
  a−(
   
    −c
   
  )=a+c.
 
 The distance from 
 
  (
   
    c,0
   
  )
 
 to 
 
  (
   
    a,0
   
  )
 
 is 
 
  c−a.
 
 The difference of the distances from the foci to the vertex is 
 
  (
   
    a+c
   
  )−(
   
    c−a
   
  )=2a
 

If 
 
  (
   
    x,y
   
  )
 
 is a point on the hyperbola, we can define the following variables:
 
 
  
   
    
     d
     2
    
    =the distance from (
     
      −c,0
     
    )to (
     
      x,y
     
    )
   
  
  
   
    
     d
     1
    
    =the distance from (
     
      c,0
     
    )to (
     
      x,y
     
    )
   
  
 

By definition of a hyperbola, 
 
  
   d
   2
  
  −
   d
   1
  

 
 is constant for any point 
 
  (
   
    x,y
   
  )
 
 on the hyperbola. We know that the difference of these distances is 
 
  2a
 
 for the vertex 
 
  (a,0).
 
 It follows that 
 
  
   d
   2
  
  −
   d
   1
  
  =2a
 
 for any point on the hyperbola. As with the derivation of the equation of an ellipse, we will begin by applying the distance formula. The rest of the derivation is algebraic. Compare this derivation with the one from the previous section for ellipses.

How To
Given the equation of a hyperbola in standard form, locate its vertices and foci.

Determine whether the transverse axis lies on the x- or y-axis. Notice that 
 
  
   a
   2
  

 
 is always under the variable with the positive coefficient. So, if you set the other variable equal to zero, you can easily find the intercepts. In the case where the hyperbola is centered at the origin, the intercepts coincide with the vertices.

If the equation has the form 
 
  
   
    
     x

 then the transverse axis lies on the x-axis. The vertices are located at 
 
  (±a,0),
 
 and the foci are located at 
 
  (
   
    ±c,0
   
  ).

 so the transverse axis lies on the y-axis. The hyperbola is centered at the origin, so the vertices serve as the y-intercepts of the graph. To find the vertices, set 
 
  x=0,
 
 and solve for 
 
  y.

Therefore, the vertices are located at 
 
  (
   
    0,±7
   
  ),
 
 and the foci are located at 
 
  (
   
    0,±9

Writing Equations of Hyperbolas in Standard Form
Just as with ellipses, writing the equation for a hyperbola in standard form allows us to calculate the key features: its center, vertices, co-vertices, foci, asymptotes, and the lengths and positions of the transverse and conjugate axes. Conversely, an equation for a hyperbola can be found given its key features. We begin by finding standard equations for hyperbolas centered at the origin. Then we will turn our attention to finding standard equations for hyperbolas centered at some point other than the origin.
Hyperbolas Centered at the OriginReviewing the standard forms given for hyperbolas centered at 
 
  (
   
    0,0

   b
   2
  
  =
   c
   2
  
  −
   a
   2
  
  .
 
 This relationship is used to write the equation for a hyperbola when given the coordinates of its foci and vertices.

 write its equation in standard form.

 and 
 
  (

Finding the Equation of a Hyperbola Centered at (0,0) Given its Foci and Vertices
What is the standard form equation of the hyperbola that has vertices 
 
  (

 and foci 
 
  (
   
    ±2
     
      10
     
    
    ,0
   
  )?
 

The vertices and foci are on the x-axis. Thus, the equation for the hyperbola will have the form 
 
  
   
    
     x

The vertices are 
 
  (
   
    ±6,0

 so 
 
  a=6

  (

Hyperbolas Not Centered at the Origin Like the graphs for other equations, the graph of a hyperbola can be translated. If a hyperbola is translated 
 
  h
 
 units horizontally and 
 
  k
 
 units vertically, the center of the hyperbola will be 
 
  (
   
    h,k

 This translation results in the standard form of the equation we saw previously, with 
 
  x
 
 replaced by

Finding the Equation of a Hyperbola Centered at (h, k) Given its Foci and Vertices
What is the standard form equation of the hyperbola that has vertices at 
 
  (0,−2)
 and 
 
  (6,−2)
 and foci at 
 
  (−2,−2)
 and 
 
  (8,−2)?

The y-coordinates of the vertices and foci are the same, so the transverse axis is parallel to the x-axis. Thus, the equation of the hyperbola will have the form
 
 
  
   
    
     
      (
       
        x−h
       
      )
     
     2
    

   
   
    
     a
     2
    

   
  
  −
   
    
     
      (
       
        y−k
       
      )
     
     2
    

   
   
    
     b
     2
    

   
  
  =1
 

First, we identify the center, 
 
  (
   
    h,k
   
  ).
 
 The center is halfway between the vertices 
 
  (
   
    0,−2
   
  )
 
 and 
 
  (
   
    6,−2
   
  ).
 
 Applying the midpoint formula, we have
 
 
  (
   
    h,k
   
  )=(
   
    
     
      0+6
     
     2
    
    ,
     
−2+(
       
−2
       
      )
     
     2
    

   
  )=(
   
    3,−2
   
  )
 

Next, we find 
 
  
   a
   2
  
  .
 
 The length of the transverse axis, 
 
  2a,
 
 is bounded by the vertices. So, we can find 
 
  
   a
   2
  

 
 by finding the distance between the x-coordinates of the vertices.
 
 
  
   
    
     
      2a=| 
       0−6
       |
     
    
   
   
    
     
      2a=6
     
    
   
   
    
     
       a=3
     
    
   
   
    
     
      
       a
       2
      
      =9
     
    
   

  
 

Now we need to find 
 
  
   c
   2
  
  .
 
 The coordinates of the foci are 
 
  (
   
    h±c,k
   
  ).
 
 So 
 
  (
   
    h−c,k
   
  )=(
   
    −2,−2
   
  )
 
 and 
 
(
   
    h+c,k
   
  )=(
   
    8,−2
   
  ).
 
 We can use the x-coordinate from either of these points to solve for 
 
  c.
 
 Using the point 
 
(
   
    8,−2
   
  ),
 
 and substituting 
 
  h=3,
 

 
 
  
   
    
     
      h+c=8
     
    
   
   
    
     
      3+c=8
     
    
   
   
    
     
           c=5
     
    
   
   
    
     
         
       c
       2
      
      =25
     
    
   

  
 

Next, solve for 
 
  
   b
   2
  

 
 using the equation 
 
  
   b
   2
  
  =
   c
   2

      =
       c

         =16
     
    
   

  
 

Finally, substitute the values found for 
 
  h,k,
   a
   2
  
  ,
 
 and 
 
  
   b
   2

 Graphing Hyperbolas Centered at the Origin
When we have an equation in standard form for a hyperbola centered at the origin, we can interpret its parts to identify the key features of its graph: the center, vertices, co-vertices, asymptotes, foci, and lengths and positions of the transverse and conjugate axes. To graph hyperbolas centered at the origin, we use the standard form

Plot and label the vertices and co-vertices, and then sketch the central rectangle. Sides of the rectangle are parallel to the axes and pass through the vertices and co-vertices. Sketch and extend the diagonals of the central rectangle to show the asymptotes. The central rectangle and asymptotes provide the framework needed to sketch an accurate graph of the hyperbola.

 Graphing Hyperbolas Not Centered at the Origin

Graphing hyperbolas centered at a point

 other than the origin is similar to graphing ellipses centered at a point other than the origin. We use the standard forms

 Thus, the transverse axis is parallel to the x-axis. It follows that:the center of the ellipse is

    2,−5

the coordinates of the vertices are

Solving Applied Problems Involving Hyperbolas
As we discussed at the beginning of this section, hyperbolas have real-world applications in many fields, such as astronomy, physics, engineering, and architecture. The design efficiency of hyperbolic cooling towers is particularly interesting. Cooling towers are used to transfer waste heat to the atmosphere and are often touted for their ability to generate power efficiently. Because of their hyperbolic form, these structures are able to withstand extreme winds while requiring less material than any other forms of their size and strength. See . For example, a 500-foot tower can be made of a reinforced concrete shell only 6 or 8 inches wide!

The first hyperbolic towers were designed in 1914 and were 35 meters high. Today, the tallest cooling towers are in France, standing a remarkable 170 meters tall. In  we will use the design layout of a cooling tower to find a hyperbolic equation that models its sides.

Solving Applied Problems Involving Hyperbolas 
The design layout of a cooling tower is shown in . The tower stands 179.6 meters tall. The diameter of the top is 72 meters. At their closest, the sides of the tower are 60 meters apart.

Project design for a natural draft cooling towerFind the equation of the hyperbola that models the sides of the cooling tower. Assume that the center of the hyperbola—indicated by the intersection of dashed perpendicular lines in the figure—is the origin of the coordinate plane. Round final values to four decimal places.

We are assuming the center of the tower is at the origin, so we can use the standard form of a horizontal hyperbola centered at the origin:

     b
     2
    

   
  
  =1,
 
 where the branches of the hyperbola form the sides of the cooling tower. We must find the values of 
 
  
   a
   2
  

 
 and 
 
  
   b
   2
  

 
 to complete the model.First, we find 
 
  
   a
   2
  
  .
 
 Recall that the length of the transverse axis of a hyperbola is 
 
  2a.
 
 This length is represented by the distance where the sides are closest, which is given as 
 
  60
 
 meters. So, 
 
  2a=60.
 
 Therefore, 
 
  a=30
 
 and 
 
  
   a
   2
  
  =900.
 

To solve for 
 
  
   b
   2
  
  ,
 
  we need to substitute for 
 
  x
 
 and 
 
  y
 
 in our equation using a known point. To do this, we can use the dimensions of the tower to find some point 
 
  (
   
    x,y
   
  )
 
 that lies on the hyperbola. We will use the top right corner of the tower to represent that point. Since the y-axis bisects the tower, our x-value can be represented by the radius of the top, or 36 meters. The y-value is represented by the distance from the origin to the top, which is given as 79.6 meters. Therefore,

A design for a cooling tower project is shown in . Find the equation of the hyperbola that models the sides of the cooling tower. Assume that the center of the hyperbola—indicated by the intersection of dashed perpendicular lines in the figure—is the origin of the coordinate plane. Round final values to four decimal places.

 The sides of the tower can be modeled by the hyperbolic equation.

   Key Concepts
A hyperbola is the set of all points 
 
  (
   
    x,y
   
  )
 
 in a plane such that the difference of the distances between 
 
  (
   
    x,y
   
  )
 
 and the foci is a positive constant.
The standard form of a hyperbola can be used to locate its vertices and foci. See .
When given the coordinates of the foci and vertices of a hyperbola, we can write the equation of the hyperbola in standard form. See  and .

When given an equation for a hyperbola, we can identify its vertices, co-vertices, foci, asymptotes, and lengths and positions of the transverse and conjugate axes in order to graph the hyperbola. See  and .

Real-world situations can be modeled using the standard equations of hyperbolas. For instance, given the dimensions of a natural draft cooling tower, we can find a hyperbolic equation that models its sides. See .

Define a hyperbola in terms of its foci.
A hyperbola is the set of points in a plane the difference of whose distances from two fixed points (foci) is a positive constant.
What can we conclude about a hyperbola if its asymptotes intersect at the origin?
What must be true of the foci of a hyperbola?
The foci must lie on the transverse axis and be in the interior of the hyperbola.
If the transverse axis of a hyperbola is vertical, what do we know about the graph?
Where must the center of hyperbola be relative to its foci?
The center must be the midpoint of the line segment joining the foci.

AlgebraicFor the following exercises, determine whether the following equations represent hyperbolas. If so, write in standard form.

For the following exercises, assume an object enters our solar system and we want to graph its path on a coordinate system with the sun at the origin and the x-axis as the axis of symmetry for the object's path. Give the equation of the flight path of each object using the given information.The object enters along a path approximated by the line 
 
  y=x−2
 
 and passes within 1 au (astronomical unit) of the sun at its closest approach, so that the sun is one focus of the hyperbola. It then departs the solar system along a path approximated by the line 
 
  y=−x+2.
 
 
The object enters along a path approximated by the line 
 
  y=2x−2
 
 and passes within 0.5 au of the sun at its closest approach, so the sun is one focus of the hyperbola. It then departs the solar system along a path approximated by the line 
 
  y=−2x+2.
