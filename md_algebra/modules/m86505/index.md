About *College Algebra 2e with Corequisite Support*
===================================================
*College Algebra 2e with Corequisite Support* integrates comprehensive algebraic principles with effective foundational review. Each *College Algebra 2e* textbook section is paired with a thoughtfully developed, topically aligned skills module that prepares students for the course material. The modules include conceptual overviews, worked examples, and guided practice; they incorporate relevant material from OpenStax’s Developmental Math series. The modular approach and richness of content ensure that the book meets the needs of a variety of courses. *College Algebra 2e with Corequisite Support* offers a wealth of examples with detailed, conceptual explanations, building a strong foundation in the material before asking students to apply what they’ve learned.

Development Overview
====================
*College Algebra 2e with Corequisite Support* is the product of a collaborative effort by a group of dedicated authors, and instructors experience and expertise led to a highly flexible and supportive resource for student at a range of levels. Special thanks is due the original *College Algebra* author, Jay Abramson of Arizona State University. Based on the widely used core text, Corequisite leader Sharon North (St. Louis Community College) developed a coordinated set of support resources, which provide review, instruction, and practice for algebra students.
The author team identified foundational skills and concepts, then mapped them to each module.  These became the Corequisite Skills modules that precede each section of the text.  In addition, Professor North authored a set of Labs designed for use in classes or workshops.
The collective experience of our author team allowed us to pinpoint the subtopics, exceptions, and individual connections that give students the most trouble.  The textbook is therefore replete with well-designed features and highlights, which help students overcome these barriers.  As the students read and practice, they are coached in methods of thinking through problems and internalizing mathematical processes.

Changes to the Second Edition
=============================

The *College Algebra 2e with Corequisite Support*revision focused on mathematical clarity and accuracy as well as inclusivity. Examples, Exercises, and Solutions were reviewed by multiple faculty experts. All improvement suggestions and errata updates, driven by faculty and students from several thousand colleges, were considered and unified across the different formats of the text.

OpenStax and our authors are aware of the difficulties posed by shifting problem and exercise numbers when textbooks are revised. In an effort to make the transition to the 2nd edition as seamless as possible, we have minimized any shifting of exercise numbers.

The revision also focused on supporting inclusive and welcoming learning experiences. The introductory narratives, example and problem contexts, and even many of the names used for fictional people in the text were all reviewed using a diversity, equity, and inclusion framework. Several hundred resulting revisions improve the balance and relevance to the students using the text, while maintaining a variety of applications to diverse careers and academic fields. In particular, explanations of scientific and historical aspects of mathematics have been expanded to include more contributors. For example, the authors added additional historical and multicultural context regarding what is widely known as Pascal’s Triangle, and similarly added details regarding the international process of decoding the Enigma machine (including the role of Polish college students). Several-chapter opening narratives and in-chapter references are completely new, and contexts across all chapters were specifically reviewed for equity in gender representation and connotation.

Finally, prior to the release of this edition, OpenStax published a version to support Corequisite instruction, which is described in more detail below.

Pedagogical Foundations and Features
====================================

Corequisite Skills Modules
==========================
Each *College Algebra 2e* section begins with a carefully developed skills component, designed to guide students though the prequisite material and provide the strongest possible foundation for their work.  While the modules draw from some elements of OpenStax *Intermediate Algebra*, each one was adapted and enhance with new material to be most effective for students.
The skills modules consist of the following:
Learning Objectives identifying the key concepts to be learned before students move on
Conceptual explanations and connections to subsequent material
Detailed worked examples
Practice problems
The Corequisite skills modules are also available for download and printing on the *College Algebra 2e with Corequisite Support* book page.

Examples
========
Each learning objective is supported by one or more worked examples that demonstrate the problem-solving approaches that students must master. The multiple Examples model different approaches to the same type of problem or introduce similar problems of increasing complexity.
All Examples follow a simple two- or three-part format. The question clearly lays out a mathematical problem to solve.  The Solution walks through the steps, usually providing context for the approach — in other words, why the instructor is solving the problem in a specific manner.  Finally, the Analysis (for select examples)  reflects  on the broader implications of the Solution just shown. Examples are followed by a “Try It” question, as explained below.

Figures
=======
*College Algebra 2e with Corequisite Support* contains many figures and illustrations, the vast majority of which are graphs and diagrams. Art throughout the text adheres to a clear, understated style, drawing the eye to the most important information in each figure while minimizing visual distractions. Color contrast is employed with discretion to distinguish between the different functions or features of a graph.

  

Supporting Features
===================
Several elements, each marked by a distinctive icon, contribute to and check understanding.

A *How To* is a list of steps necessary to solve a certain type of problem. A How To typically precedes an Example that proceeds to demonstrate the steps in action.   

A *Try It* exercise immediately follows an Example or a set of related Examples, providing the student with an immediate opportunity to solve a similar problem. In the PDF and the Web View version of the core *College Algebra* portions of the text, answers to the Try It exercises are located in the Answer Key. Answers to the Try It Exercises for the Corequisite Skills subsections are provided to instructors only so that they can decide on the best way to use them. 

A *Q&A* may appear at any point in the narrative, but most often follows an Example. This feature pre-empts misconceptions by posing a commonly asked yes/no question, followed by a detailed answer and explanation.  

The *Media* icon appears at the conclusion of each section, just prior to the Section Exercises. This icon marks a list of links to online video tutorials that reinforce the concepts and skills introduced in the section. 

While we have selected tutorials that closely align to our learning objectives, we did not produce these tutorials, nor were they specifically produced or tailored to accompany *College Algebra 2e with Corequisite Support*.

Section Exercises
=================
Each section of every chapter concludes with a well-rounded set of exercises that can be assigned as homework or used selectively for guided practice. With over 4600 exercises across the 9 chapters, instructors should have plenty from which to choose.

Section Exercises are organized by question type, and generally appear in the following order:
*Verbal* questions assess conceptual understanding of key terms and concepts.
*Algebraic* problems require students to apply algebraic manipulations demonstrated in the section.
*Graphical* problems assess students’ ability to interpret or produce a graph.
*Numeric* problems require the student to perform calculations or computations.
*Technology* problems encourage exploration through use of a graphing utility, either to visualize or verify algebraic results or to solve problems via an alternative to the methods demonstrated in the section.
*Extensions* pose problems more challenging than the Examples demonstrated in the section. They require students to synthesize multiple learning objectives or apply critical thinking to solve complex problems.
*Real-World Applications* present realistic problem scenarios from fields such as physics, geology, biology, finance, and the social sciences.

Chapter Review Features
=======================
Each chapter concludes with a review of the most important takeaways, as well as additional practice problems that students can use to prepare for exams.

*Key Terms* provides a formal definition for each bold-faced term in the chapter. 
*Key Equations* presents a compilation of formulas, theorems, and standard-form equations. 
*Key Concepts* summarizes the most important ideas introduced in each section, linking back to the relevant Example(s) in case students need to review.
*Chapter Review Exercises* include 40-80 practice problems that recall the most important concepts from each section.
*Practice Test* includes 25-50 problems assessing the most important learning objectives from the chapter. Note that the practice test is not organized by section, and may be more heavily weighted toward cumulative objectives as opposed to the foundational objectives covered in the opening sections. 
*Answer Key* includes the answers to all Try It exercises and every other exercise from the Section Exercises, Chapter Review Exercises, and Practice Test.

Accuracy of the Content
=======================
We understand that precision and accuracy are imperatives in mathematics, and undertook an accuracy program led by experienced faculty. Examples, art, problems, and solutions were reviewed by dedicated faculty, with a separate team evaluating the answer key and solutions.

The text also benefits from years of usage by thousands of faculty and students. A core aspect of the second edition revision process included consolidating and ensuring consistency with regard to any errata and corrections that have been implemented during the series' extensive usage and incorporation into homework systems.

  
Answers to Questions in the Book
================================

  Answers to Examples and Q&A are displayed directly below the question. All answers to Try It questions are available in the Answer Key. Answers to odd-numbered Section Exercises, Review Questions, and Practice Test questions are available in the Answer Key as well. Instructors can find answers to Corequisite Skill problems in the Instructor Answer Guide via the Instructor Resources page. Students are not provided answers to these problems as they are often used in graded assignments.

Additional Resources
====================

Student and Instructor Resources
================================
We’ve compiled additional resources for both students and instructors, including Getting Started Guides, an instructor solution manual, and PowerPoint slides.
