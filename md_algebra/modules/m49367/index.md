If you have a savings account, you have experienced the use of an exponential function. There are two formulas that are used to determine the balance in the account when interest is earned. If a principal, P, is invested at an interest rate, r, for t years, the new balance, A, will depend on how often the interest is compounded.Compound InterestFor a principal, P, invested at an interest rate, r, for t years, the new balance, A, is:

Exponential Growth and DecayOther topics that are modeled by exponential functions involve growth and decay. Both also use the formula A=Pert we used for the growth of money. For growth and decay, generally we use A0, as the original amount instead of calling it P, the principal. We see that exponential growth has a positive rate of growth and exponential decay has a negative rate of growth.Exponential Growth and DecayFor an original amount, A0, that grows or decays at a rate, r, for a certain time, t, the final amount, A, is:
 A=A0ert

A Logarithmic Function is the function in the form f(x)= ________, where a> ________, x> ________, and a≠ ________.
The Logarithmic Function f(x)=lnx is called the ________ and has a base ________.Decibel Level of Sound
There are many applications that are modeled by logarithmic equations. We will first look at the logarithmic equation that gives the decibel (dB) level of sound. Decibels range from 0, which is barely audible to 160, which can rupture an eardrum. The10-12 in the formula represents the intensity of sound that is barely audible.
The loudness level, D, measured in decibels, of a sound of intensity, I, measured in watts per square inch is
 D=10log(I10−12) 
Use logarithmic models in applications.

The magnitude R of an earthquake is measured by a logarithmic scale called the Richter scale. The model is R=logI, where I is the intensity of the shock wave. This model provides a way to measure earthquake intensity.Earthquake IntensityThe magnitude R of an earthquake is measured by R=logI, where I is the intensity of its shock wave.

In 1906, San Francisco experienced an intense earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 on the Richter scale. Over 80% of the city was destroyed by the resulting fires. In 2014, Los Angeles experienced a moderate earthquake that measured 5.1 on the Richter scale and caused $108 million dollars of damage. Compare the intensities of the two earthquakes.

To compare the intensities, we first need to convert the magnitudes to intensities using the log formula. Then we will set up a ratio to compare the intensities.

A nuclear research reactor inside the Neely Nuclear Research Center on the Georgia Institute of Technology campus (credit: Georgia Tech Research Institute)We have already explored some basic applications of exponential and logarithmic functions. In this section, we explore some important applications in more depth, including radioactive isotopes and Newton’s Law of Cooling.

Modeling Exponential Growth and DecayIn real-world applications, we need to model the behavior of a function. In mathematical modeling, we choose a familiar general function with properties that suggest that it will model the real-world phenomenon we wish to analyze. In the case of rapid growth, we may choose the exponential growth function: y=A0ekt

where A0 is equal to the value at time zero, e is Euler’s constant, and k is a positive constant that determines the rate (percentage) of growth. We may use the exponential growth function in applications involving doubling time, the time it takes for a quantity to double. Such phenomena as wildlife populations, financial investments, biological samples, and natural resources may exhibit growth based on a doubling time. In some applications, however, as we will see when we discuss the logistic equation, the logistic model sometimes fits the data better than the exponential model.On the other hand, if a quantity is falling rapidly toward zero, without ever reaching zero, then we should probably choose the exponential decay model. Again, we have the form y=A0ekt where A0 is the starting value, and e is Euler’s constant. Now k is a negative constant that determines the rate of decay. We may use the exponential decay model when we are calculating half-life, or the time it takes for a substance to exponentially decay to half of its original quantity. We use half-life in applications involving radioactive isotopes.In our choice of a function to serve as a mathematical model, we often use data points gathered by careful observation and measurement to construct points on a graph and hope we can recognize the shape of the graph. Exponential growth and decay graphs have a distinctive shape, as we can see in  and . It is important to remember that, although parts of each of the two graphs seem to lie on the x-axis, they are really a tiny distance above the x-axis.

A graph showing exponential growth. The equation is y=2e3x. 

A graph showing exponential decay. The equation is y=3e−2x. 

Exponential growth and decay often involve very large or very small numbers. To describe these numbers, we often use orders of magnitude. The order of magnitude is the power of ten, when the number is expressed in scientific notation, with one digit to the left of the decimal. For example, the distance to the nearest star, Proxima Centauri, measured in kilometers, is 40,113,497,200,000 kilometers. Expressed in scientific notation, this is 4.01134972×1013. So, we could describe this number as having order of magnitude 1013. 
Characteristics of the Exponential Function, y=A0ekt 

An exponential function with the form y=A0ekt has the following characteristics:

one-to-one function
horizontal asymptote: y=0 
domain: (–∞, ∞) 
range: (0,∞) 
x intercept: none
y-intercept: (0,A0) 
increasing if k>0 (see )
decreasing if k<0 (see )

An exponential function models exponential growth when k>0 and exponential decay when k<0. 

Graphing Exponential Growth
A population of bacteria doubles every hour. If the culture started with 10 bacteria, graph the population as a function of time.

When an amount grows at a fixed percent per unit time, the growth is exponential. To find A0 we use the fact that A0 is the amount at time zero, so A0=10. To find k, use the fact that after one hour (t=1) the population doubles from 10 to 20. The formula is derived as follows
 

20=10

Analysis 
The population of bacteria after ten hours is 10,240. We could describe this amount is being of the order of magnitude 104. The population of bacteria after twenty hours is 10,485,760 which is of the order of magnitude 107, so we could say that the population has increased by three orders of magnitude in ten hours.

Half-LifeWe now turn to exponential decay. One of the common terms associated with exponential decay, as stated above, is half-life, the length of time it takes an exponentially decaying quantity to decrease to half its original amount. Every radioactive isotope has a half-life, and the process describing the exponential decay of an isotope is called radioactive decay.To find the half-life of a function describing exponential decay, solve the following equation:
 12A0=Aoekt We find that the half-life depends only on the constant k and not on the starting quantity A0.

Since t, the time, is positive, k must, as expected, be negative. This gives us the half-life formula

 t=−ln(2)k

Given the half-life, find the decay rate.
Write A=Aoekt. 
Replace A by 12A0 and replace t by the given half-life.
Solve to find k. Express k as an exact value (do not round).

Note: It is also possible to find the decay rate using k=−ln(2)t.

Radiocarbon Dating
The formula for radioactive decay is important in radiocarbon dating, which is used to calculate the approximate date a plant or animal died. Radiocarbon dating was discovered in 1949 by Willard Libby, who won a Nobel Prize for his discovery. It compares the difference between the ratio of two isotopes of carbon in an organic artifact or fossil to the ratio of those two isotopes in the air. It is believed to be accurate to within about 1% error for plants or animals that died within the last 60,000 years.
Carbon-14 is a radioactive isotope of carbon that has a half-life of 5,730 years. It occurs in small quantities in the carbon dioxide in the air we breathe. Most of the carbon on Earth is carbon-12, which has an atomic weight of 12 and is not radioactive. Scientists have determined the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 in the air for the last 60,000 years, using tree rings and other organic samples of known dates—although the ratio has changed slightly over the centuries.As long as a plant or animal is alive, the ratio of the two isotopes of carbon in its body is close to the ratio in the atmosphere. When it dies, the carbon-14 in its body decays and is not replaced. By comparing the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 in a decaying sample to the known ratio in the atmosphere, the date the plant or animal died can be approximated.
Since the half-life of carbon-14 is 5,730 years, the formula for the amount of carbon-14 remaining after t years is

 To find the age of an object, we solve this equation for t: 
 t=ln(AA0)−0.000121
 Out of necessity, we neglect here the many details that a scientist takes into consideration when doing carbon-14 dating, and we only look at the basic formula. The ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 in the atmosphere is approximately 0.0000000001%. Let r be the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 in the organic artifact or fossil to be dated, determined by a method called liquid scintillation. From the equation A≈A0e−0.000121t we know the ratio of the percentage of carbon-14 in the object we are dating to the initial amount of carbon-14 in the object when it was formed is r=AA0≈e−0.000121t. We solve this equation for t, to get
 t=ln(r)−0.000121

Analysis 
The instruments that measure the percentage of carbon-14 are extremely sensitive and, as we mention above, a scientist will need to do much more work than we did in order to be satisfied. Even so, carbon dating is only accurate to about 1%, so this age should be given as 

13,301 years±1% or 13,301 years±133 years.

Calculating Doubling Time
For decaying quantities, we determined how long it took for half of a substance to decay. For growing quantities, we might want to find out how long it takes for a quantity to double. As we mentioned above, the time it takes for a quantity to double is called the doubling time.

Using Newton’s Law of Cooling
Exponential decay can also be applied to temperature. When a hot object is left in surrounding air that is at a lower temperature, the object’s temperature will decrease exponentially, leveling off as it approaches the surrounding air temperature. On a graph of the temperature function, the leveling off will correspond to a horizontal asymptote at the temperature of the surrounding air. Unless the room temperature is zero, this will correspond to a vertical shift of the generic exponential decay function. This translation leads to Newton’s Law of Cooling, the scientific formula for temperature as a function of time as an object’s temperature is equalized with the ambient temperature

A cheesecake is taken out of the oven with an ideal internal temperature of 

165°F,

 and is placed into a 

35°F

 refrigerator. After 10 minutes, the cheesecake has cooled to 

150°F.

 If we must wait until the cheesecake has cooled to 

70°F

 before we eat it, how long will we have to wait?

Because the surrounding air temperature in the refrigerator is 35 degrees, the cheesecake’s temperature will decay exponentially toward 35, following the equation

Using Logistic Growth ModelsExponential growth cannot continue forever. Exponential models, while they may be useful in the short term, tend to fall apart the longer they continue. Consider an aspiring writer who writes a single line on day one and plans to double the number of lines she writes each day for a month. By the end of the month, she must write over 17 billion lines, or one-half-billion pages. It is impractical, if not impossible, for anyone to write that much in such a short period of time. Eventually, an exponential model must begin to approach some limiting value, and then the growth is forced to slow. For this reason, it is often better to use a model with an upper bound instead of an exponential growth model, though the exponential growth model is still useful over a short term, before approaching the limiting value.The logistic growth model is approximately exponential at first, but it has a reduced rate of growth as the output approaches the model’s upper bound, called the carrying capacity. For constants 

a, b,

 and 

c,

 the logistic growth of a population over time 

t

 is represented by the model 

f(t)=
c

1+a
e

−bt

The graph in  shows how the growth rate changes over time. The graph increases from left to right, but the growth rate only increases until it reaches its point of maximum growth rate, at which point the rate of increase decreases.

Logistic Growth

The logistic growth model is 

f(t)=
c

1+a
e

−bt

 where

 

c

1+a

 is the initial value
 

c

 is the carrying capacity, or limiting value
 

b

 is a constant determined by the rate of growth.

Using the Logistic-Growth Model
An influenza epidemic spreads through a population rapidly, at a rate that depends on two factors: The more people who have the flu, the more rapidly it spreads, and also the more uninfected people there are, the more rapidly it spreads. These two factors make the logistic model a good one to study the spread of communicable diseases. And, clearly, there is a maximum value for the number of people infected: the entire population.
For example, at time 

t=0

 there is one person in a community of 1,000 people who has the flu. So, in that community, at most 1,000 people can have the flu. Researchers find that for this particular strain of the flu, the logistic growth constant is 

b=0.6030.

 Estimate the number of people in this community who will have had this flu after ten days. Predict how many people in this community will have had this flu after a long period of time has passed.

We substitute the given data into the logistic growth model
 

f(t)=
c

1+a
e

−bt

 Because at most 1,000 people, the entire population of the community, can get the flu, we know the limiting value is 

c=1000.

 To find 

a,

 we use the formula that the number of cases at time 

t=0

 is 

c

1+a

=1,

 from which it follows that 

a=999.

 This model predicts that, after ten days, the number of people who have had the flu is 

f(t)=

1000

1+999
e

−0.6030x

≈293.8.

 Because the actual number must be a whole number (a person has either had the flu or not) we round to 294. In the long term, the number of people who will contract the flu is the limiting value, 

c=1000.

 

Analysis 
Remember that, because we are dealing with a virus, we cannot predict with certainty the number of people infected. The model only approximates the number of people infected and will not give us exact or actual values. 
The graph in  gives a good picture of how this model fits the data.

Choosing an Appropriate Model for Data
Now that we have discussed various mathematical models, we need to learn how to choose the appropriate model for the raw data we have. Many factors influence the choice of a mathematical model, among which are experience, scientific laws, and patterns in the data itself. Not all data can be described by elementary functions. Sometimes, a function is chosen that approximates the data over a given interval. For instance, suppose data were gathered on the number of homes bought in the United States from the years 1960 to 2013. After plotting these data in a scatter plot, we notice that the shape of the data from the years 2000 to 2013 follow a logarithmic curve. We could restrict the interval from 2000 to 2010, apply regression analysis using a logarithmic model, and use it to predict the number of home buyers for the year 2015.
Three kinds of functions that are often useful in mathematical models are linear functions, exponential functions, and logarithmic functions. If the data lies on a straight line, or seems to lie approximately along a straight line, a linear model may be best. If the data is non-linear, we often consider an exponential or logarithmic model, though other models, such as quadratic models, may also be considered.
In choosing between an exponential model and a logarithmic model, we look at the way the data curves. This is called the concavity. If we draw a line between two data points, and all (or most) of the data between those two points lies above that line, we say the curve is concave down. We can think of it as a bowl that bends downward and therefore cannot hold water. If all (or most) of the data between those two points lies below the line, we say the curve is concave up. In this case, we can think of a bowl that bends upward and can therefore hold water. An exponential curve, whether rising or falling, whether representing growth or decay, is always concave up away from its horizontal asymptote. A logarithmic curve is always concave away from its vertical asymptote. In the case of positive data, which is the most common case, an exponential curve is always concave up, and a logarithmic curve always concave down.
A logistic curve changes concavity. It starts out concave up and then changes to concave down beyond a certain point, called a point of inflection.
After using the graph to help us choose a type of function to use as a model, we substitute points, and solve to find the parameters. We reduce round-off error by choosing points as far apart as possible.

First, plot the data on a graph as in . For the purpose of graphing, round the data to two decimal places.

Clearly, the points do not lie on a straight line, so we reject a linear model. If we draw a line between any two of the points, most or all of the points between those two points lie above the line, so the graph is concave down, suggesting a logarithmic model. We can try 

y=aln(bx).

 Plugging in the first point, 

(

1,0

),

 gives 

0=alnb.

 We reject the case that 

a=0

 (if it were, all outputs would be 0), so we know 

ln(b)=0.

 Thus 

b=1

 and 

y=aln(
x
).

 Next we can use the point 

(

9,4.394

)

 to solve for 

a:

 
 

y=aln(x)

4.394=aln(9)

a=

4.394

ln(9)

Because 

a=

4.394

ln(
9
)

≈2,

 an appropriate model for the data is 

y=2ln(
x
).

 
To check the accuracy of the model, we graph the function together with the given points as in .

y=2lnx.

 

We can conclude that the model is a good fit to the data.
Compare  to the graph of 

y=ln(

x
2

)

 shown in .

The graph of 

y=ln(

x

)

 The graphs appear to be identical when 

x>0.

 A quick check confirms this conclusion: 

y=ln(

x
2

)=2ln(
x
)

 for 

x>0.

 However, if 

x<0,

 the graph of 

y=ln(

x
2

)

 includes a “extra” branch, as shown in . This occurs because, while 

y=2ln(
x
)

 cannot have negative values in the domain (as such values would force the argument to be negative), the function 

y=ln(

x
2

)

 can have negative domain values.

With what kind of exponential model would half-life be associated? What role does half-life play in these models?
Half-life is a measure of decay and is thus associated with exponential decay models. The half-life of a substance or quantity is the amount of time it takes for half of the initial amount of that substance or quantity to decay.

What is carbon dating? Why does it work? Give an example in which carbon dating would be useful.

With what kind of exponential model would doubling time be associated? What role does doubling time play in these models?
Doubling time is a measure of growth and is thus associated with exponential growth models. The doubling time of a substance or quantity is the amount of time it takes for the initial amount of that substance or quantity to double in size.

Define Newton’s Law of Cooling. Then name at least three real-world situations where Newton’s Law of Cooling would be applied.

What is an order of magnitude? Why are orders of magnitude useful? Give an example to explain.
An order of magnitude is the nearest power of ten by which a quantity exponentially grows. It is also an approximate position on a logarithmic scale; Sample response: Orders of magnitude are useful when making comparisons between numbers that differ by a great amount. For example, the mass of Saturn is 95 times greater than the mass of Earth. This is the same as saying that the mass of Saturn is about

 times, or 2 orders of magnitude greater, than the mass of Earth.
