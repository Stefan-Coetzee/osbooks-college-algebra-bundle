Graph exponential functions.

On the same coordinate system graph $f\left(x\right)={2}^{x}$ and $g\left(x\right)={2}^{x+1}.$

We will use point plotting to graph the functions.

![This table has seven rows and five columns. The first row is header row and reads x, f of x equals 2 to the x power, (x, f of x), g of x equals 2 to the x plus 1 power, and (x, g of x). The second row reads negative 2, 2 to the negative 2 power equals 1 divided by 2 squared which equals 1 over 4, (negative 2, 1 over 4), 2 to the negative 2 plus 1 power equals 1 divided by 2 to the first power which equals 1 over 2, (negative 2, 1 over 2). The third row reads negative 1, 2 to the negative 1 power equals 1 divided by 2 to the first power which equals 1 over 2, (negative 1, 1 over 2), 2 to the negative 1 plus 1 power equals 2 to the 0 power which equals 1, (negative 1, 1). The fourth row reads 0, 2 to the 0 power equals 1, (0, 1), 2 to the 0 plus 1 power equals 2 to the 1 power which equals 2, (0, 2). The fifth row reads 1, 2 to the 1 power equals 2, (1, 2), 2 to the 1 plus 1 power equals 2 to the second power which equals 4, (1, 4). The sixth row reads 2, 2 to the 2 power equals 4, (2, 4), 2 to the 2 plus 1 power equals 2 to the third power which equals 8, (2, 8). The seventh row reads 3, 2 to the 3 power equals 8, (3, 8), 2 to the 3 plus 1 power equals 2 to the fourth power which equals 16, (3, 16).](../../media/CNX_IntAlg_Figure_10_02_008_img.jpg)

 Looking at the graphs of the functions
 $f\left(x\right)={2}^{x}$ and $g\left(x\right)={2}^{x+1}$ above, we see that adding one in the exponent caused a horizontal shift of one unit to the left. We can use this pattern to graph other functions using horizontal shifts.

On the same coordinate system graph $f\left(x\right)={3}^{x}$ and $g\left(x\right)={3}^{x}-2.$

We will use point plotting to graph the functions.

![This table has five rows and six columns. The first row is header row and reads x, f of x equals 3 to the x power, (x, f of x), g of x equals 3 to the x power minus 2, and (x, g of x). The second row reads negative 2, 3 to the negative 2 power equals 1 over 9, (negative 2, 1 over 9), 3 to the negative 2 power minus 2 equals 1 over 9 minus 2 which equals negative 17 over 9, (negative 2, negative 17 over 9). The third row reads negative 1, 3 to the negative 1 power equals 1 over 3, (negative 1, 1 over 3), 3 to the negative 1 power minus 2 equals 1 over 3 minus 2 which equals negative 5 over 3, (negative 1, negative 5 over 3). The fourth row reads 0, 3 to the 0 power equals 1, (0, 1), 3 to the 0 power minus 2 equals 1 minus 2 which equals negative 1, (0, negative 1).

 Looking at the graphs of the functions $f\left(x\right)={3}^{x}$ and $g\left(x\right)={3}^{x}-2$, we see that subtracting 2 caused
vertical shift of down two units. Notice that the horizontal asymptote also shifted down 2 units. We can
use this pattern to help graph other functions with a vertical shift.

Objective 2: Function transformations (exponential). (CA 3.5.1-3.5.5)
=====================================================================
Vertical and Horizontal Shifts:
===============================
Given a function $f(x)$ , a new function $g(x)=f(x)+k$ where $k$ is a constant, is a **vertical shift** of the function $f(x)$. All the output values change by *k* units. If *k* is a positive, the graph will shift up. If *k* is negative, the graph will shift down.
Given a function $f(x)$ , a new function $g(x)=f(x-h)$ , where *h* is a constant, is a **horizontal shift** of the function $f(x)$ . If *h* is positive, the graph will shift right. If *h* is negative, the graph will shift left.
*Given a function and both a vertical and a horizontal shift, sketch the graph.*

Identify the vertical and horizontal shifts from the formula.
The vertical shift results from a constant added to the output. Move the graph up for a positive constant and down for a negative constant.
The horizontal shift results from a constant added to the input. Move the graph left for a positive constant and right for a negative constant.
Note the order of the shifts, transformations, and reflections follow the order of operations.

As we discussed in the previous section, exponential functions are used for many real-world applications such as finance, forensics, computer science, and most of the life sciences. Working with an equation that describes a real-world situation gives us a method for making predictions. Most of the time, however, the equation itself is not enough. We learn a lot about things by seeing their pictorial representations, and that is exactly why graphing exponential equations is a powerful tool. It gives us another layer of insight for predicting future events.

Graphing Exponential Functions
==============================
Before we begin graphing, it is helpful to review the behavior of exponential growth. Recall the table of values for a function of the form $f(x)={b}^{x}$ whose base is greater than one. We’ll use the function $f(x)={2}^{x}.$ Observe how the output values in  change as the input increases by $1.$

*$x$*

 $-3$ 
 $-2$ 
 $-1$ 
 $0$ 
 $1$ 
 $2$ 
 $3$ 

*$f(x)={2}^{x}$*
 $\frac{1}{8}$ 
 $\frac{1}{4}$ 
 $\frac{1}{2}$ 
 $1$ 
 $2$ 
 $4$ 
 $8$ 

Each output value is the product of the previous output and the base, $2.$ We call the base $2$ the *constant ratio*. In fact, for any exponential function with the form $f(x)=a{b}^{x},$ $b$ is the constant ratio of the function. This means that as the input increases by 1, the output value will be the product of the base and the previous output, regardless of the value of $a.$
Notice from the table that

the output values are positive for all values of $x;$ 
as $x$ increases, the output values increase without bound; and
as $x$ decreases, the output values grow smaller, approaching zero.

\n\n![Notice that the graph gets close to the *x*-axis, but never touches it.](../../media/CNX_Precalc_Figure_04_02_001.jpg)\n\nThe domain of $f(x)={2}^{x}$ is all real numbers, the range is $\left(0,\infty \right),$ and the horizontal asymptote is $y=0.$
To get a sense of the behavior of **exponential decay**, we can create a table of values for a function of the form $f(x)={b}^{x}$ whose base is between zero and one. We’ll use the function $g(x)={\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}^{x}.$ Observe how the output values in  change as the input increases by $1.$

*$x$*

Again, because the input is increasing by 1, each output value is the product of the previous output and the base, or constant ratio $\frac{1}{2}.$

the output values are positive for all values of $x;$ 
as $x$ increases, the output values grow smaller, approaching zero; and
as $x$ decreases, the output values grow without bound.

Plot at least $3$ point from the table, including the *y*-intercept $\left(0,1\right).$ 
Draw a smooth curve through the points.

Sketching the Graph of an Exponential Function of the Form *f*(*x*) = *b**x*
============================================================================
Sketch a graph of $f(x)={0.25}^{x}.$ State the domain, range, and asymptote.

Before graphing, identify the behavior and create a table of points for the graph.

Since $b=0.25$ is between zero and one, we know the function is decreasing. The left tail of the graph will increase without bound, and the right tail will approach the asymptote $y=0.$ 
Create a table of points as in .

Graphing Transformations of Exponential Functions
=================================================

Transformations of exponential graphs behave similarly to those of other functions. Just as with other parent functions, we can apply the four types of transformations—shifts, reflections, stretches, and compressions—to the parent function $f(x)={b}^{x}$ without loss of shape. For instance, just as the quadratic function maintains its parabolic shape when shifted, reflected, stretched, or compressed, the exponential function also maintains its general shape regardless of the transformations applied.

Graphing a Vertical Shift
=========================
The first transformation occurs when we add a constant $d$ to the parent function $f(x)={b}^{x},$ giving us a **vertical shift** $d$ units in the same direction as the sign. For example, if we begin by graphing a parent function, $f(x)={2}^{x},$ we can then graph two vertical shifts alongside it, using $d=3:$ the upward shift, $g(x)={2}^{x}+3$ and the downward shift, $h(x)={2}^{x}-3.$ Both vertical shifts are shown in .
\n\n![Image](../../media/CNX_Precalc_Figure_04_02_006.jpg)\n\n

Observe the results of shifting $f(x)={2}^{x}$ vertically:

The domain, $\left(-\infty ,\infty \right)$ remains unchanged.
When the function is shifted up $3$ units to $g(x)={2}^{x}+3:$

The *y-*intercept shifts up $3$ units to $\left(0,4\right).$ 
The asymptote shifts up $3$ units to $y=3.$ 
The range becomes $\left(3,\infty \right).$ 

When the function is shifted down $3$ units to $h(x)={2}^{x}-3:$

The *y-*intercept shifts down $3$ units to $\left(0,-2\right).$ 
The asymptote also shifts down $3$ units to $y=-3.$ 
The range becomes $\left(-3,\infty \right).$ 

Graphing a Horizontal Shift
===========================

The next transformation occurs when we add a constant $c$ to the input of the parent function $f(x)={b}^{x},$ giving us a **horizontal shift** $c$ units in the *opposite* direction of the sign. For example, if we begin by graphing the parent function $f(x)={2}^{x},$ we can then graph two horizontal shifts alongside it, using $c=3:$ the shift left, $g(x)={2}^{x+3},$ and the shift right, $h(x)={2}^{x-3}.$ Both horizontal shifts are shown in .
\n\n![Image](../../media/CNX_Precalc_Figure_04_02_007.jpg)\n\n

Observe the results of shifting $f(x)={2}^{x}$ horizontally:

The domain, $\left(-\infty ,\infty \right),$ remains unchanged.
The asymptote, $y=0,$ remains unchanged.
The *y-*intercept shifts such that:
When the function is shifted left $3$ units to $g(x)={2}^{x+3},$ the *y*-intercept becomes $\left(0,8\right).$ This is because ${2}^{x+3}=\left(8\right){2}^{x},$ so the initial value of the function is $8.$ 
When the function is shifted right $3$ units to $h(x)={2}^{x-3},$ the *y*-intercept becomes $\left(0,\frac{1}{8}\right).$ Again, see that ${2}^{x-3}=\left(\frac{1}{8}\right){2}^{x},$ so the initial value of the function is $\frac{1}{8}.$ 

Shifts of the Parent Function *f*(*x*) = *b**x*
===============================================

For any constants $c$ and $d,$ the function $f(x)={b}^{x+c}+d$ shifts the parent function $f(x)={b}^{x}$

vertically $d$ units, in the *same* direction of the sign of $d.$ 
horizontally $c$ units, in the *opposite* direction of the sign of $c.$ 
The *y*-intercept becomes $\left(0,{b}^{c}+d\right).$ 
The horizontal asymptote becomes $y=d.$ 
The range becomes $\left(d,\infty \right).$ 
The domain, $\left(-\infty ,\infty \right),$ remains unchanged.

How To
*Given an exponential function with the form $f(x)={b}^{x+c}+d,$ graph the translation.*

Draw the horizontal asymptote $y=d.$ 
Identify the shift as $\left(-c,d\right).$ Shift the graph of $f(x)={b}^{x}$ left $c$ units if $c$ is positive, and right $c$ units if $c$ is negative.
Shift the graph of $f(x)={b}^{x}$ up $d$ units if $d$ is positive, and down $d$ units if $d$ is negative.
State the domain, $\left(-\infty ,\infty \right),$ the range, $\left(d,\infty \right),$ and the horizontal asymptote $y=d.$ 

Graphing a Shift of an Exponential Function
===========================================

Graph $f(x)={2}^{x+1}-3.$ State the domain, range, and asymptote.

We have an exponential equation of the form $f(x)={b}^{x+c}+d,$ with $b=2,$ $c=1,$ and $d=-3.$
Draw the horizontal asymptote $y=d$ , so draw $y=\mathrm{-3.}$
Identify the shift as $\left(-c,d\right),$ so the shift is $\left(-1,\mathrm{-3}\right).$
Shift the graph of $f(x)={b}^{x}$ left 1 units and down 3 units.

How To
*Given an equation of the form $f(x)={b}^{x+c}+d$ for $x,$ use a graphing calculator to approximate the solution.*

Press *[Y=]*. Enter the given exponential equation in the line headed “*Y1=*”.
Enter the given value for $f(x)$ in the line headed “*Y2=*”.
Press *[WINDOW]*. Adjust the *y*-axis so that it includes the value entered for “*Y2=*”.
Press *[GRAPH]* to observe the graph of the exponential function along with the line for the specified value of $f(x).$ 
To find the value of $x,$ we compute the point of intersection. Press *[2ND]*then *[CALC]*. Select “intersect” and press *[ENTER]* three times. The point of intersection gives the value of *x*for the indicated value of the function.

Approximating the Solution of an Exponential Equation

Press *[Y=]* and enter $1.2{\left(5\right)}^{x}+2.8$ next to *Y1*=. Then enter 42 next to *Y2=*. For a window, use the values –3 to 3 for $x$ and –5 to 55 for $y.$ Press *[GRAPH]*. The graphs should intersect somewhere near $x=2.$

For a better approximation, press *[2ND]*then *[CALC]*. Select *[5: intersect]* and press *[ENTER]* three times. The *x*-coordinate of the point of intersection is displayed as 2.1661943. (Your answer may be different if you use a different window or use a different value for *Guess?*) To the nearest thousandth, $x\approx \mathrm{2.166.}$

$x\approx -1.608$

Graphing a Stretch or Compression
=================================

While horizontal and vertical shifts involve adding constants to the input or to the function itself, a **stretch** or **compression** occurs when we multiply the parent function $f(x)={b}^{x}$ by a constant $\left|a\right|>0.$ For example, if we begin by graphing the parent function $f(x)={2}^{x},$ we can then graph the stretch, using $a=3,$ to get $g(x)=3{\left(2\right)}^{x}$ as shown on the left in , and the compression, using $a=\frac{1}{3},$ to get $h(x)=\frac{1}{3}{\left(2\right)}^{x}$ as shown on the right in .

\n\n![(a) $g(x)=3{\left(2 ight)}^{x}$ stretches the graph of $f(x)={2}^{x}$ vertically by a factor of $3.$ (b) $h(x)=\frac{1}{3}{\left(2 ight)}^{x}$ compresses the graph of $f(x)={2}^{x}$ vertically by a factor of $\frac{1}{3}.$](../../media/CNX_Precalc_Figure_04_02_010.jpg)\n\n

has a *y*-intercept of $\left(0,a\right).$ 
has a horizontal asymptote at $y=0,$ a range of $\left(0,\infty \right),$ and a domain of $\left(-\infty ,\infty \right),$ which are unchanged from the parent function.

Graphing the Stretch of an Exponential Function
===============================================
Sketch a graph of $f(x)=4{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}^{x}.$ State the domain, range, and asymptote.

Before graphing, identify the behavior and key points on the graph.

Since $b=\frac{1}{2}$ is between zero and one, the left tail of the graph will increase without bound as $x$ decreases, and the right tail will approach the *x*-axis as $x$ increases.
Since $a=4,$ the graph of $f(x)={\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}^{x}$ will be stretched by a factor of $4.$

Graphing Reflections
====================

In addition to shifting, compressing, and stretching a graph, we can also reflect it about the *x*-axis or the *y*-axis. When we multiply the parent function $f(x)={b}^{x}$ by $\mathrm{-1},$ we get a reflection about the *x*-axis. When we multiply the input by $\mathrm{-1},$ we get a **reflection** about the *y*-axis. For example, if we begin by graphing the parent function $f(x)={2}^{x},$ we can then graph the two reflections alongside it. The reflection about the *x*-axis, $g(x)={\mathrm{-2}}^{x},$ is shown on the left side of , and the reflection about the *y*-axis $h(x)={2}^{-x},$ is shown on the right side of .

has a *y*-intercept of $\left(0,-1\right).$ 
has a range of $\left(-\infty ,0\right).$ 
has a horizontal asymptote at $y=0$ and domain of $\left(-\infty ,\infty \right),$ which are unchanged from the parent function.
The function $f(x)={b}^{-x}$

reflects the parent function $f(x)={b}^{x}$ about the *y*-axis.
has a *y*-intercept of $\left(0,1\right),$ a horizontal asymptote at $y=0,$ a range of $\left(0,\infty \right),$ and a domain of $\left(-\infty ,\infty \right),$ which are unchanged from the parent function.

Writing and Graphing the Reflection of an Exponential Function
==============================================================

Find and graph the equation for a function, $g(x),$ that reflects $f(x)={\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)}^{x}$ about the *x*-axis. State its domain, range, and asymptote.

Since we want to reflect the parent function $f(x)={\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)}^{x}$ about the *x-*axis, we multiply $f(x)$ by $-1$ to get, $g(x)=-{\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)}^{x}.$ Next we create a table of points as in .

Translations of Exponential Functions
=====================================

A translation of an exponential function has the form

$\ f(x)=a{b}^{x+c}+d$ 

Where the parent function, $y={b}^{x},$ $b>1,$ is

shifted horizontally $c$ units to the left.
stretched vertically by a factor of $\left|a\right|$ if $\left|a\right|>0.$ 
compressed vertically by a factor of $\left|a\right|$ if $0<\left|a\right|<1.$ 
shifted vertically $d$ units.
reflected about the *x-*axis when $a<0.$ 

Note the order of the shifts, transformations, and reflections follow the order of operations.

Writing a Function from a Description
=====================================
Write the equation for the function described below. Give the horizontal asymptote, the domain, and the range.

 $f(x)={e}^{x}$ is vertically stretched by a factor of $2$ , reflected across the *y*-axis, and then shifted up $4$ units.

We want to find an equation of the general form $\ \phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}f(x)=a{b}^{x+c}+d.$ We use the description provided to find $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d.$
We are given the parent function $f(x)={e}^{x},$ so $b=e.$ 
The function is stretched by a factor of $2$ , so $a=2.$ 
The function is reflected about the *y*-axis. We replace $x$ with $-x$ to get: ${e}^{-x}.$ 
The graph is shifted vertically 4 units, so $d=4.$ 
Substituting in the general form we get,

 $$
\begin{array}{ll}\ f(x)\hfill & =a{b}^{x+c}+d\hfill \\ \hfill & =2{e}^{-x+0}+4\hfill \\ \hfill & =2{e}^{-x}+4\hfill \end{array}
$$ The domain is $\left(-\infty ,\infty \right);$ the range is $\left(4,\infty \right);$ the horizontal asymptote is $y=4.$

Try It

Write the equation for function described below. Give the horizontal asymptote, the domain, and the range.

 $f(x)={e}^{x}$ is compressed vertically by a factor of $\frac{1}{3},$ reflected across the *x*-axis and then shifted down $2$ units.

$f(x)=-\frac{1}{3}{e}^{x}-2;$ the domain is $\left(-\infty ,\infty \right);$ the range is $\left(-\infty ,\mathrm{-2}\right);$ the horizontal asymptote is $y=\mathrm{-2.}$

Graph Exponential Functions

Key Equations
=============

General Form for the Translation of the Parent Function  $\text{}f(x)={b}^{x}$ 
 $f(x)=a{b}^{x+c}+d$ 

Key Concepts
============

The graph of the function $f(x)={b}^{x}$ has a *y-*intercept at $\left(0,\ 1\right),$ domain $\left(-\infty ,\ \infty \right),$ range $\left(0,\ \infty \right),$ and horizontal asymptote $y=0.$ See .
If $b>1,$ the function is increasing. The left tail of the graph will approach the asymptote $y=0,$ and the right tail will increase without bound.
If $0<b<1,$ the function is decreasing. The left tail of the graph will increase without bound, and the right tail will approach the asymptote $y=0.$ 
The equation $f(x)={b}^{x}+d$ represents a vertical shift of the parent function $f(x)={b}^{x}.$ 
The equation $f(x)={b}^{x+c}$ represents a horizontal shift of the parent function $f(x)={b}^{x}.$ See .
Approximate solutions of the equation $f(x)={b}^{x+c}+d$ can be found using a graphing calculator. See .
The equation $f(x)=a{b}^{x},$ where $a>0,$ represents a vertical stretch if $\left|a\right|>1$ or compression if $0<\left|a\right|<1$ of the parent function $f(x)={b}^{x}.$ See .
When the parent function $f(x)={b}^{x}$ is multiplied by $-1,$ the result, $f(x)=-{b}^{x},$ is a reflection about the  *x*-axis. When the input is multiplied by $-1,$ the result, $f(x)={b}^{-x},$ is a reflection about the *y*-axis. See .
All translations of the exponential function can be summarized by the general equation $f(x)=a{b}^{x+c}+d.$ See .
Using the general equation $f(x)=a{b}^{x+c}+d,$ we can write the equation of a function given its description. See .

What role does the horizontal asymptote of an exponential function play in telling us about the end behavior of the graph?

An asymptote is a line that the graph of a function approaches, as $x$ either increases or decreases without bound. The horizontal asymptote of an exponential function tells us the limit of the function’s values as the independent variable gets either extremely large or extremely small.

What is the advantage of knowing how to recognize transformations of the graph of a parent function algebraically?
