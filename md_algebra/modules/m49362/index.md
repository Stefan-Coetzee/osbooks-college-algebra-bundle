  Graph exponential functions.

On the same coordinate system graph f(x)=2x and g(x)=2x+1. 

We will use point plotting to graph the functions.

 Looking at the graphs of the functions
 f(x)=2x and g(x)=2x+1 above, we see that adding one in the exponent caused a horizontal shift of one unit to the left. We can use this pattern to graph other functions using horizontal shifts.

On the same coordinate system graph f(x)=3x and g(x)=3x−2. 

We will use point plotting to graph the functions.

 Looking at the graphs of the functions f(x)=3x and g(x)=3x−2, we see that subtracting 2 caused
vertical shift of down two units. Notice that the horizontal asymptote also shifted down 2 units. We can
use this pattern to help graph other functions with a vertical shift.

Objective 2: Function transformations (exponential). (CA 3.5.1-3.5.5)Vertical and Horizontal Shifts: Given a function f(x) , a new function g(x)=f(x)+k where k is a constant, is a vertical shift of the function f(x). All the output values change by k units. If k is a positive, the graph will shift up. If k is negative, the graph will shift down. Given a function f(x) , a new function g(x)=f(x-h) , where h is a constant, is a horizontal shift of the function f(x) . If h is positive, the graph will shift right. If h is negative, the graph will shift left. Given a function and both a vertical and a horizontal shift, sketch the graph.
Identify the vertical and horizontal shifts from the formula.
The vertical shift results from a constant added to the output. Move the graph up for a positive constant and down for a negative constant.
The horizontal shift results from a constant added to the input. Move the graph left for a positive constant and right for a negative constant.
Note the order of the shifts, transformations, and reflections follow the order of operations.

How To
   Given a function, reflect the graph both vertically and horizontally.
   
   Multiply all outputs by –1 for a vertical reflection. The new graph is a reflection of the original graph about the x-axis.
   Multiply all inputs by –1 for a horizontal reflection. The new graph is a reflection of the original graph about the y-axis.

As we discussed in the previous section, exponential functions are used for many real-world applications such as finance, forensics, computer science, and most of the life sciences. Working with an equation that describes a real-world situation gives us a method for making predictions. Most of the time, however, the equation itself is not enough. We learn a lot about things by seeing their pictorial representations, and that is exactly why graphing exponential equations is a powerful tool. It gives us another layer of insight for predicting future events.

Graphing Exponential FunctionsBefore we begin graphing, it is helpful to review the behavior of exponential growth. Recall the table of values for a function of the form 

f(x)=
b
x

 whose base is greater than one. We’ll use the function 

f(x)=
2
x

.

Each output value is the product of the previous output and the base, 

2.

 We call the base 

2

 the constant ratio. In fact, for any exponential function with the form 

f(x)=a
b
x

,

 

b

 is the constant ratio of the function. This means that as the input increases by 1, the output value will be the product of the base and the previous output, regardless of the value of 

a.

 Notice from the table that

the output values are positive for all values of 

x;

 
as 

x

 increases, the output values increase without bound; and
as 

x

 decreases, the output values grow smaller, approaching zero.

 To get a sense of the behavior of exponential decay, we can create a table of values for a function of the form 

f(x)=

 whose base is between zero and one. We’ll use the function

Graphing Transformations of Exponential Functions
Transformations of exponential graphs behave similarly to those of other functions. Just as with other parent functions, we can apply the four types of transformations—shifts, reflections, stretches, and compressions—to the parent function 

f(x)=
b
x

 without loss of shape. For instance, just as the quadratic function maintains its parabolic shape when shifted, reflected, stretched, or compressed, the exponential function also maintains its general shape regardless of the transformations applied.

Graphing a Vertical ShiftThe first transformation occurs when we add a constant 

d

 to the parent function 

f(x)=
b
x

,

 giving us a vertical shift 

d

 units in the same direction as the sign. For example, if we begin by graphing a parent function, 

f(x)=
2
x

,

 we can then graph two vertical shifts alongside it, using 

d=3:

 the upward shift, 

g(x)=
2
x

+3

 and the downward shift, 

h(x)=
2
x

−3.

 Both vertical shifts are shown in .

Observe the results of shifting 

f(x)=
2
x

 vertically:

The domain, 

(

−∞,∞

)

 remains unchanged.
When the function is shifted up 

3

 units to 

g(x)=
2
x

+3:

The y-intercept shifts up 

3

 units to 

(

0,4

).

 
The asymptote shifts up 

3

 units to 

y=3.

 
The range becomes 

(

3,∞

).

 

When the function is shifted down 

3

 units to 

h(x)=
2
x

−3:

The y-intercept shifts down 

3

 units to 

(

0,−2

).

 
The asymptote also shifts down 

3

 units to 

y=−3.

 
The range becomes 

(

−3,∞

).

 

Graphing a Horizontal Shift
The next transformation occurs when we add a constant 

c

 to the input of the parent function 

f(x)=
b
x

,

 giving us a horizontal shift 

c

 units in the opposite direction of the sign. For example, if we begin by graphing the parent function 

f(x)=
2
x

,

 we can then graph two horizontal shifts alongside it, using 

c=3:

 the shift left, 

g(x)=
2

x+3

,

 and the shift right, 

h(x)=
2

x−3

.

 Both horizontal shifts are shown in .

Observe the results of shifting 

f(x)=
2
x

 horizontally:

The domain, 

(

−∞,∞

),

 remains unchanged.
The asymptote, 

y=0,

 remains unchanged.
The y-intercept shifts such that:
When the function is shifted left 

3

 units to 

g(x)=
2

x+3

,

 the y-intercept becomes 

(

0,8

).

 This is because 

2

x+3

=(
8
)
2
x

,

 so the initial value of the function is 

8.

 
When the function is shifted right 

3

 units to 

h(x)=
2

x−3

,

 the y-intercept becomes 

(

0,
1
8

).

 Again, see that 

2

x−3

=(

1
8

)
2
x

,

 so the initial value of the function is 

1
8

.

 

Shifts of the Parent Function f(x) = bx

c

 and 

d,

f(x)=
b

f(x)=
b
x

 

vertically 

d

 units, in the same direction of the sign of 

d.

 
horizontally 

c

 units, in the opposite direction of the sign of 

c.

 
The y-intercept becomes 

(

0,
b
c

+d

).

 
The horizontal asymptote becomes 

y=d.

 
The range becomes 

(

d,∞

).

 
The domain, 

(

),

 remains unchanged.

Press [WINDOW]. Adjust the y-axis so that it includes the value entered for “Y2=”.
Press [GRAPH] to observe the graph of the exponential function along with the line for the specified value of 

f(x).

Graphing a Stretch or Compression
While horizontal and vertical shifts involve adding constants to the input or to the function itself, a stretch or compression occurs when we multiply the parent function 

f(x)=
b
x

 by a constant 

|a|>0.

 For example, if we begin by graphing the parent function 

f(x)=
2
x

,

 we can then graph the stretch, using 

a=3,

 to get 

g(x)=3

(
2
)

x

 as shown on the left in , and the compression, using 

a=
1
3

,

 to get 

h(x)=

(

)

x

 as shown on the right in .

(a) 

g(x)=3

Graphing Reflections
In addition to shifting, compressing, and stretching a graph, we can also reflect it about the x-axis or the y-axis. When we multiply the parent function 

f(x)=
b
x

 by 

−1,

 we get a reflection about the x-axis. When we multiply the input by 

−1,

 we get a reflection about the y-axis. For example, if we begin by graphing the parent function 

f(x)=
2
x

,

 we can then graph the two reflections alongside it. The reflection about the x-axis, 

g(x)=
−2
x

,

 is shown on the left side of , and the reflection about the y-axis 

h(x)=

What role does the horizontal asymptote of an exponential function play in telling us about the end behavior of the graph?

An asymptote is a line that the graph of a function approaches, as 

x

 either increases or decreases without bound. The horizontal asymptote of an exponential function tells us the limit of the function’s values as the independent variable gets either extremely large or extremely small.

What is the advantage of knowing how to recognize transformations of the graph of a parent function algebraically?
