  As we have seen, conic sections are formed when a plane intersects two right circular cones aligned tip to tip and extending infinitely far in opposite directions, which we also call a cone. The way in which we slice the cone will determine the type of conic section formed at the intersection. A circle is formed by slicing a cone with a plane perpendicular to the axis of symmetry of the cone. An ellipse is formed by slicing a single cone with a slanted plane not perpendicular to the axis of symmetry. A parabola is formed by slicing the plane through the top or bottom of the double-cone, whereas a hyperbola is formed when the plane slices both the top and bottom of the cone. See .
    
   

  The nondegenerate conic sectionsEllipses, circles, hyperbolas, and parabolas are sometimes called the nondegenerate conic sections, in contrast to the degenerate conic sections, which are shown in . A degenerate conic results when a plane intersects the double cone and passes through the apex. Depending on the angle of the plane, three types of degenerate conic sections are possible: a point, a line, or two intersecting lines. 
    
   

  Degenerate conic sectionsIdentifying Nondegenerate Conics in General FormIn previous sections of this chapter, we have focused on the standard form equations for nondegenerate conic sections. In this section, we will shift our focus to the general form equation, which can be used for any conic. The general form is set equal to zero, and the terms and coefficients are given in a particular order, as shown below.

  where 
   
    A,B,
   
   and 
   
    C
   
   are not all zero. We can use the values of the coefficients to identify which type conic is represented by a given equation.You may notice that the general form equation has an 
   
    xy
   
   term that we have not seen in any of the standard form equations. As we will discuss later, the 
   
    xy
   
   term rotates the conic whenever 
 
  B
 
 is not equal to zero.

How To
   Given the equation of a conic, identify the type of conic.
   
   Rewrite the equation in the general form, 
     
      A

      +Bxy+C
       y

      +Dx+Ey+F=0.
     
    
    
    Identify the values of 
     
      A
     
     and 
     
      C
     
     from the general form.
     If 
      
      A
      
      and 
      
      C
      
      are nonzero, have the same sign, and are not equal to each other, then the graph may be an ellipse.
      If 
       
        A
       
       and 
       
        C
       
       are equal and nonzero and have the same sign, then the graph may be a circle.
      If 
       
        A
       
       and 
       
        C
       
       are nonzero and have opposite signs, then the graph may be a hyperbola.
      If either 
       
        A
       
       or 
       
        C
       
       is zero, then the graph may be a parabola.If B = 0, the conic section will have a vertical and/or horizontal axes. If B does not equal 0, as shown below, the conic section is rotated.

Notice the phrase “may be” in the definitions. That is because the equation may not represent a conic section at all, depending on the values of A, B, C, D, E, and F. For example, the degenerate case of a circle or an ellipse is a point:

 
     
      A
       x
       2
      
      +By2=0, 
     
    

when A and B have the same sign.

The degenerate case of a hyperbola is two intersecting straight lines:
 
     
      A
       x
       2
      
      +By2=0, 
     
    

when A and B have opposite signs.

On the other hand, the equation,
 
     
      A
       x
       2
      
      +By2+1=0, 
     
    

when A and B are positive does not represent a graph at all, since there are no real ordered pairs which satisfy it.

       A=4
      
      and 
      
      C=−9,
      
      so we observe that 
      
      A
      
      and 
      
      C
      
      have opposite signs. The graph of this equation is a hyperbola.

      C=9.

      A
      
      is zero.

   Finding a New Representation of the Given Equation after Rotating through a Given Angle
   Until now, we have looked at equations of conic sections without an 
    
     xy
    
    term, which aligns the graphs with the x- and y-axes. When we add an 
    
     xy
    
    term, we are rotating the conic about the origin. If the x-  and y-axes are rotated through an angle, say 
    
     θ,
    
    then every point on the plane may be thought of as having two representations: 
    
     (
      
       x,y
      
      )
    
    on the Cartesian plane with the original x-axis and y-axis, and 
 
  (
   
    
     x
     ′
    
    ,
     y
     ′
    
    
  )
 on the new plane defined by the new, rotated axes, called the x'-axis and y'-axis. See .

Equations of Rotation

    If a point 
     
      (
       
        x,y
       
       )
     
     on the Cartesian plane is represented on a new coordinate plane where the axes of rotation are formed by rotating an angle 
     
      θ
     
     from the positive x-axis, then the coordinates of the point with respect to the new axes are 
     
      (
       
        
         x
         ′
        
        ,
         y
         ′
        

       
       ).
     
     We can use the following equations of rotation to define the relationship between 
     
      (
       
        x,y
       
       )
     
     and

 Writing Equations of Rotated Conics in Standard FormNow that we can find the standard form of a conic when we are given an angle of rotation, we will learn how to transform the equation of a conic given in the form 
   
    A
     x
     2
    
    +Bxy+C
     y
     2
    
    +Dx+Ey+F=0
   
   into standard form by rotating the axes. To do so, we will rewrite the general form as an equation in the 
   
    
     x
     ′
    

   
   and 
   
    
     y

   coordinate system without the 
   
    
     x
     ′
    
    
     y
     ′
    

   
   term, by rotating the axes by a measure of 
   
    θ
   
   that satisfies
   
   
    cot(
     
      2θ
     
     )=
      
       A−C
      
      B
     

   
  
  
  We have learned already that any conic may be represented by the second degree equation
   
   
    A
     x
     2
    
    +Bxy+C
     y
     2
    
    +Dx+Ey+F=0
   
  
  
  where 
   
    A,B,
   
   and 
   
    C
   
   are not all zero. However, if 
   
    B≠0,
   
   then we have an 
   
    xy
   
   term that prevents us from rewriting the equation in standard form. To eliminate it, we can rotate the axes by an acute angle 
   
    θ
   
   where 
   
    cot(
     
      2θ
     
     )=
      
       A−C
      
      B
     
    .
   
  

  	If 
    
     cot(2θ)>0,
    
    then 
    
     2θ
    
    is in the first quadrant, and 
    
     θ
    
    is between 
    
     (0°,45°).
    
   
   
   If 
    
     cot(2θ)<0,
    
    then 
    
     2θ
    
    is in the second quadrant, and 
    
     θ
    
    is between 
    
     (45°,90°).
    
   
   
   If 
    
     A=C,
    
    then 
    
     θ=45°.

      system:

     First, we find 
      
      cot(
        
         2θ
        
        ).

        y

       =20⇒A=1,B=12,and C=−4
      
     
     
 
 
  
   
    
     
      cot(2θ)=
       
        A−C
       
       B
      

     
    
   
   
    
     
      cot(2θ)=
       
        1−(−4)
       
       
        12
       
      

     
    
   
   
    
     
      cot(2θ)=
       5
       
        12
       
      

     
    
   

  
 

Because 
      
      cot(
        
         2θ
        
        )=
         5
         
          12
         
        
       ,
      
      we can draw a reference triangle as in .

     
      
     
    

      
      
       cot(
        
         2θ
        
        )=

         adjacent
        
        
         opposite
        
       

      
     
     
    Thus, the hypotenuse is

      +

Next, we find 
 
  sinθ

 We will use half-angle identities.

   Identifying Conics without Rotating Axes
  Now we have come full circle. How do we identify the type of conic described by an equation? What happens when the axes are rotated? Recall, the general form of a conic is
   
   
    A
     x
     2
    
    +Bxy+C
     y
     2
    
    +Dx+Ey+F=0
   
  
  
  If we apply the rotation formulas to this equation we get the form
   
   
    
     A
     ′
    
    
     
      x
      ′

    +
     B
     ′
    
    
     x
     ′
    
    
     y
     ′
    
    +
     C
     ′
    
    
     
      y
      ′
     

     2
    
    +
     D
     ′
    
    
     x
     ′
    
    +
     E
     ′
    
    
     y
     ′
    
    +
     F
     ′
    
    =0
   
  
  
  It may be shown that 
   
    
     B
     2
    
    −4AC=

     ′
    
    
     C
     ′
    
    .
   
   The expression does not vary after rotation, so we call the expression invariant. The discriminant, 
   
    
     B
     2
    
    −4AC,
   
   is invariant and remains unchanged after rotation. Because the discriminant remains unchanged, observing the discriminant enables us to identify the conic section.Using the Discriminant to Identify a Conic 

   If the equation

    then

    is an ellipse, a parabola, or a hyperbola, or a degenerate case of one of these.
   If the discriminant, 
    
     
      B
      2
     
     −4AC,
    
    is
   	 
   	  
   	   <0,
   	  
   	  the conic section is an ellipse
   	  
   	  
   	   =0,
   	  
   	  the conic section is a parabola
   	  
   	  
   	   >0,
   	  
   	  the conic section is a hyperbola

    ⓐ Let’s begin by determining 
      
      A,B,

Now, we find the discriminant.

      −4AC=

  Section ExercisesVerbalWhat effect does the 
    
     xy
    
    term have on the graph of a conic section?
   
    The 
     
      xy
     
     term causes a rotation of the graph to occur.
