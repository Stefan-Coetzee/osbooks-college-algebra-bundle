The pH of hydrochloric acid is tested with litmus paper. (credit: David Berardan)In chemistry, pH is used as a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of a substance. The pH scale runs from 0 to 14. Substances with a pH less than 7 are considered acidic, and substances with a pH greater than 7 are said to be basic. Our bodies, for instance, must maintain a pH close to 7.35 in order for enzymes to work properly. To get a feel for what is acidic and what is basic, consider the following pH levels of some common substances:
Battery acid: 0.8
Stomach acid: 2.7
Orange juice: 3.3
Pure water: 7 (at 25° C)
Human blood: 7.35
Fresh coconut: 7.8
Sodium hydroxide (lye): 14
To determine whether a solution is acidic or basic, we find its pH, which is a measure of the number of active positive hydrogen ions in the solution. The pH is defined by the following formula, where 

H+
 is the concentration of hydrogen ion  in the solution

 

pH=−log([
H
+

])

=log(

1

[
H
+

]

)

The equivalence of 

−log(

[ 

H
+

 ]

)
 and 

log(

1

[ 

H
+

 ]

)
 is one of the logarithm properties we will examine in this section.

Using the Product Rule for Logarithms
Recall that the logarithmic and exponential functions “undo” each other. This means that logarithms have similar properties to exponents. Some important properties of logarithms are given here.  First, the following properties are easy to prove.

 

log
b

1=0

log
b

b=1

 

For example, 

log

5

1=0
 since 

5
0

=1.
 And 

log

5

5=1
 since 

5
1

=5.

 

Next, we have the inverse property.

 
 
  
   
    
     
    
   
   
    
     
      
       
        log
       
       b
      
      (
       b
       x
      
      )=x
     
    
   
   
    
     
        
       b
       
        
         
          log
         
         b
        
        x
       
      
      =x,x>0
     
    
   

  
 

For example, to evaluate 

log(

100

),

 we can rewrite the logarithm as 

log

10

(

10

2

),

 and then apply the inverse property 

log

b

(

b
x

)=x
 to get 

log

10

(

10

2

)=2.

 To evaluate 

e

ln(
7
)

,

 we can rewrite the logarithm as 

e

log

e

7

,

 and then apply the inverse property 

b

log

b

x

=x
 to get 

e

log

e

7

=7.

 Finally, we have the one-to-one property. 

log

b

M=

log

b

Nif and only ifM=N

 We can use the one-to-one property to solve the equation 

log

3

(

3x

)=

log

3

(

2x+5

)
 for 

x.
 Since the bases are the same, we can apply the one-to-one property by setting the arguments equal and solving for 

x:

  

3x=2x+5

Set the arguments equal.

x=5

Subtract 2x.

 But what about the equation 

log

3

(

3x

)+

log

3

(

2x+5

)=2?
 The one-to-one property does not help us in this instance. Before we can solve an equation like this, we need a method for combining terms on the left side of the equation.

Recall that we use the product rule of exponents to combine the product of powers by adding exponents: 

x
a

x
b

=
x

a+b

.
 We have a similar property for logarithms, called the product rule for logarithms, which says that the logarithm of a product is equal to a sum of logarithms. Because logs are exponents, and we multiply like bases, we can add the exponents. We will use the inverse property to derive the product rule below.Given any real number 

x
 and positive real numbers 

M,N,

 and 

b,

 where 

b≠1,

 we will show 

log

b

(

MN

)=

log

b

(
M
)+

log

b

(
N
).

 Let 

m=

log

b

M
 and 

n=

log

b

N.
 In exponential form, these equations are 

b
m

=M
 and 

b
n

=N.
 It follows that

 

log

b

(

MN

)

=

log

b

(

)

Substitute for Mand N.

=m+n

Apply the inverse property of logs.

log

Substitute for mand n.

Note that repeated applications of the product rule for logarithms allow us to simplify the logarithm of the product of any number of factors. For example, consider 

log

b

(wxyz).
 Using the product rule for logarithms, we can rewrite this logarithm of a product as the sum of logarithms of its factors:

 

log

b

(wxyz)=

log

b

w+

log

b

x+

log

b

log

The Product Rule for Logarithms
The product rule for logarithms can be used to simplify a logarithm of a product by rewriting it as a sum of individual logarithms.

How To
Given the logarithm of a product, use the product rule of logarithms to write an equivalent sum of logarithms.

Factor the argument completely, expressing each whole number factor as a product of primes.
Write the equivalent expression by summing the logarithms of each factor.

Using the Quotient Rule for Logarithms

For quotients, we have a similar rule for logarithms. Recall that we use the quotient rule of exponents to combine the quotient of exponents by subtracting: 

x

a

x

b

=
x

a−b

.
 The quotient rule for logarithms says that the logarithm of a quotient is equal to a difference of logarithms. Just as with the product rule, we can use the inverse property to derive the quotient rule.Given any real number 

x
 and positive real numbers 

M,

 

N,

 and 

b,

 where 

b≠1,

 we will show 

log

(

b

(
M
)−

log

b

(
N
).

 Let 

m=

log

b

M
 and 

n=

log

b

N.
 In exponential form, these equations are 

b
m

=M
 and 

b
n

=N.
 It follows that

 

log

b

(

M

)

=

log

Substitute for Mand N.

For example, to expand 

log(

2
x
2

+6x

3x+9

),

 we must first express the quotient in lowest terms. Factoring and canceling we get,

 
 
  
   
    
     
      log(
       
        
         
          2
           x
           2
          
          +6x
         
         
          3x+9
         
        

       
      )=log(
       
        
         
          2x(x+3)
         
         
          3(x+3)
         
        

       
      )
     
    
    
     
      Factor the numerator and denominator.
     
    
   
   
    
     
                            =log(
       
        
         
          2x
         
         3
        

       
      )
     
    
    
     
      Cancel the common factors.
     
    
   

  
 

Next we apply the quotient rule by subtracting the logarithm of the denominator from the logarithm of the numerator. Then we apply the product rule.

 
 
  
   
    
     
      log(
       
        
         
          2x
         
         3
        

       
      )=log(2x)−log(3)
     
    
   
   
    
     
                  =log(2)+log(x)−log(3)

How To
Given the logarithm of a quotient, use the quotient rule of logarithms to write an equivalent difference of logarithms.
Express the argument in lowest terms by factoring the numerator and denominator and canceling common terms.
Write the equivalent expression by subtracting the logarithm of the denominator from the logarithm of the numerator.
Check to see that each term is fully expanded. If not, apply the product rule for logarithms to expand completely.

Using the Quotient Rule for Logarithms
Expand 

log

2

(

15x(x−1)

(3x+4)(2−x)

).

 

First we note that the quotient is factored and in lowest terms, so we apply the quotient rule.

Analysis 
There are exceptions to consider in this and later examples. First, because denominators must never be zero, this expression is not defined for 

x=−
4
3

 and 

x=2.
 Also, since the argument of a logarithm must be positive, we note as we observe the expanded logarithm, that 

x>0,

 

x>1,

 

x>−
4
3

,

 and 

x<2.
 Combining these conditions is beyond the scope of this section, and we will not consider them here or in subsequent exercises.

Using the Power Rule for Logarithms

We’ve explored the product rule and the quotient rule, but how can we take the logarithm of a power, such as

?
 One method is as follows:

 Notice that we used the product rule for logarithms to find a solution for the example above. By doing so, we have derived the power rule for logarithms, which says that the log of a power is equal to the exponent times the log of the base. Keep in mind that, although the input to a logarithm may not be written as a power, we may be able to change it to a power. For example, 

100=

Write the equivalent expression by multiplying the exponent times the logarithm of the base.

Using the Power Rule in Reverse
Rewrite 

4ln(x)
 using the power rule for logs to a single logarithm with a leading coefficient of 1.

Because the logarithm of a power is the product of the exponent times the logarithm of the base, it follows that the product of a number and a logarithm can be written as a power. For the expression 

4ln(x),

 we identify the factor, 4, as the exponent and the argument, 

x,

 as the base, and rewrite the product as a logarithm of a power: 

4ln(x)=ln(

 We can also apply the product rule to express a sum or difference of logarithms as the logarithm of a product.

With practice, we can look at a logarithmic expression and expand it mentally, writing the final answer. Remember, however, that we can only do this with products, quotients, powers, and roots—never with addition or subtraction inside the argument of the logarithm.

Expanding Logarithms Using Product, Quotient, and Power Rules
Rewrite 

ln(

x
4

y

7

)
 as a sum or difference of logs.

First, because we have a quotient of two expressions, we can use the quotient rule:
 

ln(

x
4

y

7

)=ln(

x
4

y

)−ln(7)

 
Then seeing the product in the first term, we use the product rule:
 

ln(

x
4

y

)−ln(7)=ln(

x
4

)+ln(y)−ln(7)

 
Finally, we use the power rule on the first term:
 

ln(

Condensing Logarithmic ExpressionsWe can use the rules of logarithms we just learned to condense sums, differences, and products with the same base as a single logarithm. It is important to remember that the logarithms must have the same base to be combined. We will learn later how to change the base of any logarithm before condensing.

How To
Given a sum, difference, or product of logarithms with the same base, write an equivalent expression as a single logarithm.
Apply the power property first. Identify terms that are products of factors and a logarithm, and rewrite each as the logarithm of a power.
Next apply the product property. Rewrite sums of logarithms as the logarithm of a product.
Apply the quotient property last. Rewrite differences of logarithms as the logarithm of a quotient.

Applying of the Laws of Logs
Recall that, in chemistry, 

pH=−log[
H
+

].
 If the concentration of hydrogen ions in a liquid is doubled, what is the effect on pH?

Suppose 

C
 is the original concentration of hydrogen ions, and 

P
 is the original pH of the liquid. Then 

P=–log(C).
 If the concentration is doubled, the new concentration is 

2C.

 Then the pH of the new liquid is 

pH=−log(

2C

)

 Using the product rule of logs
 

pH=−log(

2C

)=−(

log(2)+log(C)

)=−log(2)−log(C)

 
Since 

P=–log(C),

 the new pH is
 

pH=P−log(2)≈P−0.301

 When the concentration of hydrogen ions is doubled, the pH decreases by about 0.301.

Try It

How does the pH change when the concentration of positive hydrogen ions is decreased by half?

The pH increases by about 0.301.

Using the Change-of-Base Formula for LogarithmsMost calculators can evaluate only common and natural logs. In order to evaluate logarithms with a base other than 10 or 

e,

 we use the change-of-base formula to rewrite the logarithm as the quotient of logarithms of any other base; when using a calculator, we would change them to common or natural logs.To derive the change-of-base formula, we use the one-to-one property and power rule for logarithms.Given any positive real numbers 

M,b,

 and 

n,

 where 

n≠1 
 and 

b≠1,

 we show 

log

b

M=

log

n

M

 Let 

y=

By exponentiating both sides with base

, we arrive at an exponential form, namely

=M.

      Substitute for y.
     
    
   

  
 

For example, to evaluate
