## Objective 2: Find the general term (nth term) of an arithmetic sequence (IA 12.2.2)
In the last section, we found a formula for the general term of a sequence, we can also find a formula for the general term of an arithmetic sequence.
Let’s write the first few terms of a sequence where the first term is ${a}_{1}$ and the common difference is *d*. We will then look for a pattern.
As we look for a pattern we see that each term starts with ${a}_{1}$ .

![This figures shows an image of a sequence.](../../media/CNX_IntAlg_Figure_12_02_002_img.jpg)

The first term adds 0*d* to the ${a}_{1}$ , the second term adds 1*d*, the third term adds 2*d*, the fourth term adds 3*d*, and the fifth term adds 4*d*. The number of *d*s that were added to ${a}_{1}$ is one less than the number of the term. We then have the formula for the general term of an arithmetic sequence.

Companies often make large purchases, such as computers and vehicles, for business use. The book-value of these supplies decreases each year for tax purposes. This decrease in value is called depreciation. One method of calculating depreciation is straight-line depreciation, in which the value of the asset decreases by the same amount each year.

As an example, consider a woman who starts a small contracting business. She purchases a new truck for $25,000. After five years, she estimates that she will be able to sell the truck for $8,000. The loss in value of the truck will therefore be $17,000, which is $3,400 per year for five years. The truck will be worth $21,600 after the first year; $18,200 after two years; $14,800 after three years; $11,400 after four years; and $8,000 at the end of five years. In this section, we will consider specific kinds of sequences that will allow us to calculate depreciation, such as the truck’s value.

# Finding Common Differences
The values of the truck in the example are said to form an *arithmetic sequence* because they change by a constant amount each year. Each term increases or decreases by the same constant value called the *common difference* of the sequence. For this sequence, the common difference is –3,400.

![A sequence, {25000, 21600, 18200, 14800, 8000}, that shows the terms differ only by -3400.](../../media/CNX_Precalc_Figure_11_02_001.jpg)

The sequence below is another example of an arithmetic sequence. In this case, the constant difference is 3. You can choose any **term** of the **sequence**, and add 3 to find the subsequent term.

# Writing Terms of Arithmetic Sequences
Now that we can recognize an arithmetic sequence, we will find the terms if we are given the first term and the common difference. The terms can be found by beginning with the first term and adding the common difference repeatedly. In addition, any term can also be found by plugging in the values of $n$ and $d$ into formula below.
 $$
{a}_{n}={a}_{1}+(n-1)d
$$

# Using Recursive Formulas for Arithmetic Sequences
Some arithmetic sequences are defined in terms of the previous term using a **recursive formula**. The formula provides an algebraic rule for determining the terms of the sequence. A recursive formula allows us to find any term of an arithmetic sequence using a function of the preceding term. Each term is the sum of the previous term and the common difference. For example, if the common difference is 5, then each term is the previous term plus 5. As with any recursive formula, the first term must be given.
 $$
\begin{array}{lllll}{a}_{n}={a}_{n-1}+d  &   &   &   & n\ge 2  \end{array}

# Using Explicit Formulas for Arithmetic Sequences
We can think of an **arithmetic sequence** as a function on the domain of the natural numbers; it is a linear function because it has a constant rate of change. The common difference is the constant rate of change, or the slope of the function. We can construct the linear function if we know the slope and the vertical intercept.

 ${a}_{n}={a}_{1}+d(n-1)$
To find the *y*-intercept of the function, we can subtract the common difference from the first term of the sequence. Consider the following sequence.

![A sequence, {200, 150, 100, 50, 0, ...}, that shows the terms differ only by -50.](../../media/CNX_Precalc_Figure_11_02_006.jpg)

The common difference is $-50$ , so the sequence represents a linear function with a slope of $-50$ . To find the $y$ -intercept, we subtract $-50$ from $200:\phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}200-(-50)=200+50=250$ . You can also find the $y$ -intercept by graphing the function and determining where a line that connects the points would intersect the vertical axis. The graph is shown in .

![Image](../../media/CNX_Precalc_Figure_11_02_007.jpg)

Recall the slope-intercept form of a line is $y=mx+b.$ When dealing with sequences, we use ${a}_{n}$ in place of $y$ and $n$ in place of $x.$ If we know the slope and vertical intercept of the function, we can substitute them for $m$ and $b$ in the slope-intercept form of a line. Substituting $-50$ for the slope and $250$ for the vertical intercept, we get the following equation:
 $$
{a}_{n}=-50n+250
$$ We do not need to find the vertical intercept to write an **explicit formula** for an arithmetic sequence. Another explicit formula for this sequence is ${a}_{n}=200-50(n-1)$ , which simplifies to ${a}_{n}=-50n+250.$

## Solving Application Problems with Arithmetic Sequences
In many application problems, it often makes sense to use an initial term of ${a}_{0}$ instead of ${a}_{1}.$ In these problems, we alter the explicit formula slightly to account for the difference in initial terms. We use the following formula:

 $$
{a}_{n}={a}_{0}+dn
$$

22. **Solving Application Problems with Arithmetic Sequences**   A five-year old child receives an allowance of $1 each week. His parents promise him an annual increase of $2 per week.   ⓐWrite a formula for the child’s weekly allowance in a given year. ⓑWhat will the child’s allowance be when he is 16 years old?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

ⓐ
The situation can be modeled by an arithmetic sequence with an initial term of 1 and a common difference of 2.

Let $A$ be the amount of the allowance and $n$ be the number of years after age 5. Using the altered explicit formula for an arithmetic sequence we get:

 $$
{A}_{n}=1+2n
$$

ⓑ
We can find the number of years since age 5 by subtracting.

    
 $$
16-5=11
$$

# Key Concepts

An arithmetic sequence is a sequence where the difference between any two consecutive terms is a constant.
The constant between two consecutive terms is called the common difference.
The common difference is the number added to any one term of an arithmetic sequence that generates the subsequent term. See .
The terms of an arithmetic sequence can be found by beginning with the initial term and adding the common difference repeatedly. See  and .
A recursive formula for an arithmetic sequence with common difference $d$ is given by ${a}_{n}={a}_{n-1}+d,n\ge 2.$ See .
As with any recursive formula, the initial term of the sequence must be given.
An explicit formula for an arithmetic sequence with common difference $d$ is given by ${a}_{n}={a}_{1}+d(n-1).$ See .
An explicit formula can be used to find the number of terms in a sequence. See .
In application problems, we sometimes alter the explicit formula slightly to ${a}_{n}={a}_{0}+dn.$ See .

# Section Exercises

## Verbal
1. What is an arithmetic sequence?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

A sequence where each successive term of the sequence increases (or decreases) by a constant value.
</details>

2. How is the common difference of an arithmetic sequence found?

3. How do we determine whether a sequence is arithmetic?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

We find whether the difference between all consecutive terms is the same. This is the same as saying that the sequence has a common difference.
</details>

4. What are the main differences between using a recursive formula and using an explicit formula to describe an arithmetic sequence?

5. Describe how linear functions and arithmetic sequences are similar. How are they different?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Both arithmetic sequences and linear functions have a constant rate of change. They are different because their domains are not the same; linear functions are defined for all real numbers, and arithmetic sequences are defined for natural numbers or a subset of the natural numbers.
