From the air, a landscape of circular crop fields may seem random, but they are laid out and irrigated very precisely. Farmers and irrigation providers combining agricultural science, engineering, and mathematics to achieve the most productive and efficient array.

Irrigation is a critical aspect of agriculture, which can expand the yield of farms and enable farming in areas not naturally viable for crops. But the materials, equipment, and the water itself are expensive and complex. To be efficient and productive, farm owners and irrigation specialists must carefully lay out the network of pipes, pumps, and related equipment. The available land can be divided into regular portions (similar to a grid), and the different sizes of irrigation systems and conduits can be installed within the plotted area.
