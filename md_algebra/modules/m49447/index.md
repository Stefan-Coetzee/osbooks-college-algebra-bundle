===============================================================
A **series** is the sum of the terms of a sequence. For example,  1 + 6 + 11+ 16 + 21 + 26 + 31 is the sum of the first seven terms arithmetic sequence with general term, $${a}_{n}=5n-4.$$
We write a series by using the **summation notation**. In order to write that summation, we will need to find the general term of our sequence and the summation will look like:

    
  For the series, 1 + 6 + 11 + 16  + 21 + 26 + 31 + .... the summation notation is $$\sum _{n=1}^{7}5n-4$$
Use summation notation to write the sum.

  Write the sum using summation notation: $$1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{5}$$

  
    
     $$\begin{array}{cccccc}n:& 1,& 2,& 3,& 4,& 5\end{array}$$ 
  
  
    Look for a pattern in the terms.
    Terms: $$\begin{array}{cccccc}& 1,& \frac{1}{2},& \frac{1}{3},& \frac{1}{4},& \frac{1}{5}\end{array}$$ 
  
  
    The numerators are all one. The denominators are the counting numbers from 1 thru 5.

Sum of the First *n* Terms of an Arithmetic Sequence
====================================================
The sum, $${S}_{n},$$ of the first *n* terms of an arithmetic sequence is

 $${S}_{n}=\frac{n}{2}({a}_{1}+{a}_{n})$$ 
where $${a}_{1}$$ is the first term and $${a}_{n}$$ is the *n*th term.

A parent decides to start a college fund for their daughter. They plan to invest $50 in the fund each month. The fund pays 6% annual interest, compounded monthly. How much money will they have saved when their daughter is ready to start college in 6 years? In this section, we will learn how to answer this question. To do so, we need to consider the amount of money invested and the amount of interest earned.

Using Summation Notation
========================
To find the total amount of money in the college fund and the sum of the amounts deposited, we need to add the amounts deposited each month and the amounts earned monthly. The sum of the terms of a sequence is called a **series**. Consider, for example, the following series.

 $$
3+7+11+15+19+\mathrm{...}
$$ 
The ***n*th partial sum** of a series is the sum of a finite number of consecutive terms beginning with the first term. The notation $${S}_{n}$$ represents the partial sum.
 $$
\begin{array}{l}{S}_{1}=3\\ {S}_{2}=3+7=10\\ {S}_{3}=3+7+11=21\\ {S}_{4}=3+7+11+15=36\end{array}
$$ 
*Summation notation*is used to represent series. Summation notation is often known as sigma notation because it uses the Greek capital letter **sigma**, $$\text{\Sigma},$$ to represent the sum. Summation notation includes an explicit formula and specifies the first and last terms in the series. An explicit formula for each term of the series is given to the right of the sigma. A variable called the *index of summation*is written below the sigma. The index of summation is set equal to the *lower limit of summation*, which is the number used to generate the first term in the series. The number above the sigma, called the *upper limit of summation*, is the number used to generate the last term in a series.

If we interpret the given notation, we see that it asks us to find the sum of the terms in the series $${a}_{k}=2k$$ for $$k=1$$ through $$k=5.$$ We can begin by substituting the terms for $$k$$ and listing out the terms of this series.
 $$
\begin{array}{l}\begin{array}{l}\\ {a}_{1}=2(1)=2\end{array}\hfill \\ {a}_{2}=2(2)=4\hfill \\ {a}_{3}=2(3)=6\hfill \\ {a}_{4}=2(4)=8\hfill \\ {a}_{5}=2(5)=10\hfill \end{array}
$$
We can find the sum of the series by adding the terms:

 $$
{\displaystyle \sum _{k=1}^{5}2k}=2+4+6+8+10=30
$$ 

Summation Notation
==================

The sum of the first $$n$$ terms of a *series*can be expressed in **summation notation** as follows:

 $$
{\displaystyle \sum _{k=1}^{n}{a}_{k}}
$$ 
This notation tells us to find the sum of $${a}_{k}$$ from $$k=1$$ to $$k=n.$$
$$k$$ is called the **index of summation**, 1 is the **lower limit of summation**, and $$n$$ is the **upper limit of summation**.

Q&A
*Does the lower limit of summation have to be 1?*

*No. The lower limit of summation can be any number, but 1 is frequently used. We will look at examples with lower limits of summation other than 1.*

How To
*Given summation notation for a series, evaluate the value.*

Identify the lower limit of summation.
Identify the upper limit of summation.
Substitute each value of $$k$$ from the lower limit to the upper limit into the formula.
Add to find the sum.

Using Summation Notation
========================

Evaluate $${\displaystyle \sum _{k=3}^{7}{k}^{2}}.$$

According to the notation, the lower limit of summation is 3 and the upper limit is 7. So we need to find the sum of $${k}^{2}$$ from $$k=3$$ to $$k=7.$$ We find the terms of the series by substituting $$k=3\text{,}4\text{,}5\text{,}6\text{,}$$ and $$7$$ into the function $${k}^{2}.$$ We add the terms to find the sum.
 $$
\begin{array}{ll}{\displaystyle \sum _{k=3}^{7}{k}^{2}}\hfill & ={3}^{2}+{4}^{2}+{5}^{2}+{6}^{2}+{7}^{2}\hfill \\ \hfill & =9+16+25+36+49\hfill \\ \hfill & =135\hfill \end{array}

Using the Formula for Arithmetic Series
=======================================
Just as we studied special types of sequences, we will look at special types of series. Recall that an **arithmetic sequence** is a sequence in which the difference between any two consecutive terms is the **common difference**, $$d.$$ The sum of the terms of an arithmetic sequence is called an *arithmetic series*. We can write the sum of the first $$n$$ terms of an arithmetic series as:
 $$
{S}_{n}={a}_{1}+({a}_{1}+d)+({a}_{1}+2d)+\mathrm{...}+({a}_{n}\u2013d)+{a}_{n}.
$$ 
We can also reverse the order of the terms and write the sum as

 $$
{S}_{n}={a}_{n}+({a}_{n}\u2013d)+({a}_{n}\u20132d)+\mathrm{...}+({a}_{1}+d)+{a}_{1}.
$$ 
If we add these two expressions for the sum of the first $$n$$ terms of an arithmetic series, we can derive a formula for the sum of the first $$n$$ terms of any arithmetic series.
 $$
\frac{\begin{array}{l}\phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}\phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}\phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}\phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}\phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}\phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}{S}_{n}={a}_{1}+({a}_{1}+d)+({a}_{1}+2d)+\mathrm{...}+({a}_{n}\u2013d)+{a}_{n}\hfill \\ +\phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}\phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}{S}_{n}={a}_{n}+({a}_{n}\u2013d)+({a}_{n}\u20132d)+\mathrm{...}+({a}_{1}+d)+{a}_{1}\hfill \end{array}}{2{S}_{n}=({a}_{1}+{a}_{n})+({a}_{1}+{a}_{n})+\mathrm{...}+({a}_{1}+{a}_{n})}
$$
Because there are $$n$$ terms in the series, we can simplify this sum to
 $$
2{S}_{n}=n({a}_{1}+{a}_{n}).
$$ We divide by 2 to find the formula for the sum of the first $$n$$ terms of an arithmetic series.
 $$
{S}_{n}=\frac{n({a}_{1}+{a}_{n})}{2}
$$ 

Formula for the Sum of the First *n* Terms of an Arithmetic Series
==================================================================

An **arithmetic series** is the sum of the terms of an arithmetic sequence. The formula for the sum of the first $$n$$ terms of an arithmetic sequence is
 $$
{S}_{n}=\frac{n({a}_{1}+{a}_{n})}{2}

This problem can be modeled by an arithmetic series with $${a}_{1}=\frac{1}{2}$$ and $$d=\frac{1}{4}.$$ We are looking for the total number of miles walked after 8 weeks, so we know that $$n=8\text{,}$$ and we are looking for $${S}_{8}.$$ To find $${a}_{8},$$ we can use the explicit formula for an arithmetic sequence.
 $$
\begin{array}{l}\begin{array}{l}\\ {a}_{n}={a}_{1}+d(n-1)\end{array}\hfill \\ {a}_{8}=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}(8-1)=\frac{9}{4}\hfill \end{array}

Using the Formula for Geometric Series
======================================
Just as the sum of the terms of an arithmetic sequence is called an arithmetic series, the sum of the terms in a geometric sequence is called a *geometric series*. Recall that a **geometric sequence** is a sequence in which the ratio of any two consecutive terms is the **common ratio**, $$r.$$ We can write the sum of the first $$n$$ terms of a geometric series as
 $$
{S}_{n}={a}_{1}+r{a}_{1}+{r}^{2}{a}_{1}+\mathrm{...}+{r}^{n\u20131}{a}_{1}.
$$ Just as with arithmetic series, we can do some algebraic manipulation to derive a formula for the sum of the first $$n$$ terms of a geometric series. We will begin by multiplying both sides of the equation by $$r.$$
 $$
r{S}_{n}=r{a}_{1}+{r}^{2}{a}_{1}+{r}^{3}{a}_{1}+\mathrm{...}+{r}^{n}{a}_{1}
$$ Next, we subtract this equation from the original equation.
 $$
\begin{array}{l}\\ \frac{\begin{array}{l}\phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}\text{\ \ \}{S}_{n}={a}_{1}+r{a}_{1}+{r}^{2}{a}_{1}+\mathrm{...}+{r}^{n\u20131}{a}_{1}\hfill \\ -r{S}_{n}=-(r{a}_{1}+{r}^{2}{a}_{1}+{r}^{3}{a}_{1}+\mathrm{...}+{r}^{n}{a}_{1})\hfill \end{array}}{(1-r){S}_{n}={a}_{1}-{r}^{n}{a}_{1}}\end{array}
$$
Notice that when we subtract, all but the first term of the top equation and the last term of the bottom equation cancel out. To obtain a formula for $${S}_{n},$$ divide both sides by $$(1-r).$$
 $$
{S}_{n}=\frac{{a}_{1}(1-{r}^{n})}{1-r}\phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}\text{r}\ne \text{1}
$$ 

Formula for the Sum of the First *n* Terms of a Geometric Series

A **geometric series** is the sum of the terms in a geometric sequence. The formula for the sum of the first $$n$$ terms of a geometric sequence is represented as

{S}_{n}=\frac{{a}_{1}(1-{r}^{n})}{1-r}\phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}\text{r}\ne \text{1}
$$

Using the Formula for the Sum of an Infinite Geometric Series
=============================================================
Thus far, we have looked only at finite series. Sometimes, however, we are interested in the sum of the terms of an infinite sequence rather than the sum of only the first $$n$$ terms. An **infinite series** is the sum of the terms of an infinite sequence. An example of an infinite series is $$2+4+6+8+\mathrm{...}$$

This series can also be written in summation notation as $${\displaystyle \sum _{k=1}^{\infty}2k,}$$ where the upper limit of summation is infinity. Because the terms are not tending to zero, the sum of the series increases without bound as we add more terms. Therefore, the sum of this infinite series is not defined. When the sum is not a real number, we say the series **diverges**.

Determining Whether the Sum of an Infinite Geometric Series is Defined
======================================================================
If the terms of an **infinite geometric sequence** approach 0, the sum of an infinite geometric series can be defined.  The terms in this series approach 0:
 $$
1+0.2+0.04+0.008+0.0016+\mathrm{...}
$$ 
The common ratio $$r\phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}\text{=\ 0}\text{.2}.$$
 As $$n$$ gets very large, the values of $${r}^{n}$$ get very small and approach 0.   Each successive term affects the sum less than the preceding term. As each succeeding term gets closer to 0, the sum of the terms approaches a finite value. The terms of any infinite geometric series with $$-1<r<1$$ approach 0; the sum of a geometric series is defined when $$-1<r<1.$$

Determining Whether the Sum of an Infinite Geometric Series is Defined
======================================================================

The sum of an infinite series is defined if the series is geometric and $$-1<r<1.$$

*Given the first several terms of an infinite series, determine if the sum of the series exists.*

Find the ratio of the second term to the first term.
Find the ratio of the third term to the second term.
Continue this process to ensure the ratio of a term to the preceding term is constant throughout. If so, the series is geometric.
If a common ratio, $$r,$$ was found in step 3, check to see if $$-1<r<1$$ . If so, the sum is defined. If not, the sum is not defined.

Determining Whether the Sum of an Infinite Series is Defined

Finding Sums of Infinite Series
===============================
When the sum of an infinite geometric series exists, we can calculate the sum. The formula for the sum of an infinite series is related to the formula for the sum of the first $$n$$ terms of a geometric series.

 $$
{S}_{n}=\frac{{a}_{1}(1-{r}^{n})}{1-r}
$$
We will examine an infinite series with $$r=\frac{1}{2}.$$ What happens to $${r}^{n}$$ as $$n$$ increases?
 $$
\begin{array}{l}{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}^{2}=\frac{1}{4}\\ {\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}^{3}=\frac{1}{8}\\ {\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}^{4}=\frac{1}{16}\end{array}
$$

The value of $${r}^{n}$$ decreases rapidly. What happens for greater values of $$n?$$
 $$
\begin{array}{l}{(\frac{1}{2})}^{10}=\frac{1}{1\text{,}024}\hfill \\ {(\frac{1}{2})}^{20}=\frac{1}{1\text{,}048\text{,}576}\hfill \\ {(\frac{1}{2})}^{30}=\frac{1}{1\text{,}073\text{,}741\text{,}824}\hfill \end{array}
$$
As $$n$$ gets very large, $${r}^{n}$$ gets very small. We say that, as $$n$$ increases without bound, $${r}^{n}$$ approaches 0. As $${r}^{n}$$ approaches 0, $$1-{r}^{n}$$ approaches 1. When this happens, the numerator approaches $${a}_{1}.$$ This give us a formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series.

Formula for the Sum of an Infinite Geometric Series
===================================================

The formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series with $$\mathrm{-1}<r<1$$ is
 $$
S=\frac{{a}_{1}}{1-r}
$$ 

How To
*Given an infinite geometric series, find its sum.*

Identify $${a}_{1}$$ and $$r.$$ 
Confirm that $$\u20131<r<1.$$ 
Substitute values for $${a}_{1}$$ and $$r$$ into the formula, $$S=\frac{{a}_{1}}{1-r}.$$

Simplify to find $$S.$$ 

Finding the Sum of an Infinite Geometric Series
===============================================

Find the sum, if it exists, for the following:

ⓐ $$10+9+8+7+\dots $$ 
ⓑ $$248.6+99.44+39.776+\phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}\text{}\dots $$ 
ⓒ $${\displaystyle \sum}_{k=1}^{\infty}4\text{,}374\cdot {(\u2013\frac{1}{3})}^{k\u20131}$$

 ⓓ $${\displaystyle \sum}_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{9}\cdot {(\frac{4}{3})}^{k}$$

ⓐThere is not a constant ratio; the series is not geometric.
ⓑ
There is a constant ratio; the series is geometric. $${a}_{1}=248.6$$ and $$r=\frac{99.44}{248.6}=0.4,$$ so the sum exists. Substitute $${a}_{1}=248.6$$ and $$r=0.4$$ into the formula and simplify to find the sum:
 $$
\begin{array}{l}S=\frac{{a}_{1}}{1-r}\hfill \\ S=\frac{248.6}{1-0.4}=414.\overline{3}\hfill \end{array}
$$

ⓒ
The formula is exponential, so the series is geometric with $$r=\u2013\frac{1}{3}.$$ Find $${a}_{1}$$ by substituting $$k=1$$ into the given explicit formula:
 $$
{a}_{1}=4\text{,}374\cdot {(\u2013\frac{1}{3})}^{1\u20131}=4\text{,}374
$$
Substitute $${a}_{1}=4\text{,}374$$ and $$r=-\frac{1}{3}$$ into the formula, and simplify to find the sum:
 $$
\begin{array}{l}S=\frac{{a}_{1}}{1-r}\hfill \\ S=\frac{4\text{,}374}{1-(-\frac{1}{3})}=3\text{,}280.5\hfill \end{array}
$$

 ⓓThe formula is exponential, so the series is geometric, but $$r>1.$$ The sum does not exist.

Finding an Equivalent Fraction for a Repeating Decimal
======================================================

Find an equivalent fraction for the repeating decimal $$0.\overline{3}$$

We notice the repeating decimal $$0.\overline{3}=\mathrm{0.333...}$$ so we can rewrite the repeating decimal as a sum of terms.
 $$
0.\overline{3}=0.3+0.03+0.003+\mathrm{...}
$$
Looking for a pattern, we rewrite the sum, noticing that we see the first term multiplied to 0.1 in the second term, and the second term multiplied to 0.1 in the third term.

Notice the pattern; we multiply each consecutive term by a common ratio of 0.1 starting with the first term of 0.3. So, substituting into our formula for an infinite geometric sum, we have

 $$
{S}_{n}=\frac{{a}_{1}}{1-r}=\frac{0.3}{1-0.1}=\frac{0.3}{0.9}=\frac{1}{3}.
$$ 

Find the sum, if it exists.

Solving Annuity Problems
========================
At the beginning of the section, we looked at a problem in which a parent invested a set amount of money each month into a college fund for six years. An **annuity** is an investment in which the purchaser makes a sequence of periodic, equal payments. To find the amount of an annuity, we need to find the sum of all the payments and the interest earned. In the example, the parent invests $50 each month. This is the value of the initial deposit. The account paid 6% **annual interest**, compounded monthly. To find the interest rate per payment period, we need to divide the 6% annual percentage interest (APR) rate by 12. So the monthly interest rate is 0.5%. We can multiply the amount in the account each month by 100.5% to find the value of the account after interest has been added.
We can find the value of the annuity right after the last deposit by using a geometric series with $${a}_{1}=50$$ and $$r=100.5\%=\mathrm{1.005.}$$ After the first deposit, the value of the annuity will be $50. Let us see if we can determine the amount in the college fund and the interest earned.
We can find the value of the annuity after $$n$$ deposits using the formula for the sum of the first $$n$$ terms of a geometric series. In 6 years, there are 72 months, so $$n=72.$$ We can substitute $${a}_{1}=50,\ r=1.005,\ \text{and}\ n=72$$ into the formula, and simplify to find the value of the annuity after 6 years.
 $$
{S}_{72}=\frac{50(1-{1.005}^{72})}{1-1.005}\approx 4\text{,}320.44
$$
After the last deposit, the parent will have a total of $4,320.44 in the account. Notice, the parent made 72 payments of $50 each for a total of $$\text{72(50)\ =\ \$3,600}\text{.}$$ This means that because of the annuity, the parent earned $720.44 interest in their college fund.

How To
*Given an initial deposit and an interest rate, find the value of an annuity.*

Determine $${a}_{1}\text{,}$$ the value of the initial deposit.
Determine $$n\text{,}$$ the number of deposits.
Determine $$r.$$

Divide the annual interest rate by the number of times per year that interest is compounded.
Add 1 to this amount to find $$r.$$ 

Substitute values for $${a}_{1}\text{,}\phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}r,\phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}\text{and}\phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}n$$
into the formula for the sum of the first $$n$$ terms of a geometric series, $${S}_{n}=\frac{{a}_{1}(1\u2013{r}^{n})}{1\u2013r}.$$ 
Simplify to find $${S}_{n},$$ the value of the annuity after $$n$$ deposits.

Solving an Annuity Problem
==========================

A deposit of $100 is placed into a college fund at the beginning of every month for 10 years. The fund earns 9% annual interest, compounded monthly, and paid at the end of the month. How much is in the account right after the last deposit?

The value of the initial deposit is $100, so $${a}_{1}=100.$$ A total of 120 monthly deposits are made in the 10 years, so $$n=120.$$ To find $$r,$$ divide the annual interest rate by 12 to find the monthly interest rate and add 1 to represent the new monthly deposit.
 $$
r=1+\frac{0.09}{12}=1.0075
$$
Substitute $${a}_{1}=100\text{,}\phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}r=1.0075\text{,}\phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}\text{and}\phantom{\rule{0.5em}{0ex}}n=120$$ into the formula for the sum of the first $$n$$ terms of a geometric series, and simplify to find the value of the annuity.
 $$
{S}_{120}=\frac{100(1-{1.0075}^{120})}{1-1.0075}\approx 19\text{,}351.43
$$
So the account has $19,351.43 after the last deposit is made.

Try It

At the beginning of each month, $200 is deposited into a retirement fund. The fund earns 6% annual interest, compounded monthly, and paid into the account at the end of the month. How much is in the account if deposits are made for 10 years?
