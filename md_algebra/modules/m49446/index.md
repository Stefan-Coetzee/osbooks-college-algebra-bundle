Many jobs offer an annual cost-of-living increase to keep salaries consistent with inflation. Suppose, for example, a recent college graduate finds a position as a sales manager earning an annual salary of $26,000. He is promised a 2% cost of living increase each year. His annual salary in any given year can be found by multiplying his salary from the previous year by 102%. His salary will be $26,520 after one year; $27,050.40 after two years; $27,591.41 after three years; and so on. When a salary increases by a constant rate each year, the salary grows by a constant factor. In this section, we will review sequences that grow in this way.

Finding Common RatiosThe yearly salary values described form a geometric sequence because they change by a constant factor each year. Each term of a geometric sequence increases or decreases by a constant factor called the common ratio. The sequence below is an example of a geometric sequence because each term increases by a constant factor of 6. Multiplying any term of the sequence by the common ratio 6 generates the subsequent term.

Definition of a Geometric Sequence
A geometric sequence is one in which any term divided by the previous term is a constant. This constant is called the common ratio of the sequence. The common ratio can be found by dividing any term in the sequence by the previous term. If 
 
  
   a
   1
  

 
 is the initial term of a geometric sequence and 
 r
 is the common ratio, the sequence will be

 
 
  {
   a

How To
Given a set of numbers, determine if they represent a geometric sequence.

Divide each term by the previous term.
Compare the quotients. If they are the same, a common ratio exists and the sequence is geometric.

The sequence is not geometric because there is not a common ratio.

Analysis
The graph of each sequence is shown in . It seems from the graphs that both (a) and (b) appear have the form of the graph of an exponential function in this viewing window. However, we know that (a) is geometric and so this interpretation holds, but (b) is not.

Q&A
If you are told that a sequence is geometric, do you have to divide every term by the previous term to find the common ratio?
No. If you know that the sequence is geometric, you can choose any one term in the sequence and divide it by the previous term to find the common ratio.

Writing Terms of Geometric SequencesNow that we can identify a geometric sequence, we will learn how to find the terms of a geometric sequence if we are given the first term and the common ratio. The terms of a geometric sequence can be found by beginning with the first term and multiplying by the common ratio repeatedly. For instance, if the first term of a geometric sequence is 
 
  
   a
   1
  
  =−2
 
 and the common ratio is 
 
  r=4, 
 
 we can find subsequent terms by multiplying 
 
  −2⋅4
 
 to get 
 
  −8
 
 then multiplying the result 
 
  −8⋅4
 
 to get 
 
  −32
 
 and so on.
 
 
  
   
    
     
      
       a
       1
      
      =−2

       a

       a
       4
      
      =(−32⋅4)=−128
     
    
   

  
 

The first four terms are 
 
  {–2, –8, –32, –128}.
 

How To

Using Recursive Formulas for Geometric SequencesA recursive formula allows us to find any term of a geometric sequence by using the previous term. Each term is the product of the common ratio and the previous term. For example, suppose the common ratio is 9. Then each term is nine times the previous term. As with any recursive formula, the initial term must be given.

How To
Given the first several terms of a geometric sequence, write its recursive formula.

State the initial term.
Find the common ratio by dividing any term by the preceding term.
Substitute the common ratio into the recursive formula for a geometric sequence.

Using Recursive Formulas for Geometric Sequences
Write a recursive formula for the following geometric sequence.
 
 
  {6, 9, 13.5, 20.25, ...}
 

The first term is given as 6. The common ratio can be found by dividing the second term by the first term.

Analysis
The sequence of data points follows an exponential pattern. The common ratio is also the base of an exponential function as shown in 

Do we have to divide the second term by the first term to find the common ratio?
No. We can divide any term in the sequence by the previous term. It is, however, most common to divide the second term by the first term because it is often the easiest method of finding the common ratio.

Solving Application Problems with Geometric Sequences
In 2013, the number of students in a small school is 284. It is estimated that the student population will increase by 4% each year.

ⓐWrite a formula for the student population.
ⓑEstimate the student population in 2020.

ⓐ
The situation can be modeled by a geometric sequence with an initial term of 284. The student population will be 104% of the prior year, so the common ratio is 1.04.
Let 
 P
 be the student population and 
 n
 be the number of years after 2013. Using the explicit formula for a geometric sequence we get 
 
  
   P
   n
  
   =284⋅
   
    1.04
   
   n
  

 

ⓑ
We can find the number of years since 2013 by subtracting.
 
 
  2020−2013=7
 
 
We are looking for the population after 7 years. We can substitute 7 for 
 n
 to estimate the population in 2020.

Key Concepts
A geometric sequence is a sequence in which the ratio between any two consecutive terms is a constant.
The constant ratio between two consecutive terms is called the common ratio.
The common ratio can be found by dividing any term in the sequence by the previous term. See .
The terms of a geometric sequence can be found by beginning with the first term and multiplying by the common ratio repeatedly. See  and .

What is a geometric sequence?
A sequence in which the ratio between any two consecutive terms is constant.

How is the common ratio of a geometric sequence found?

What is the procedure for determining whether a sequence is geometric?
Divide each term in a sequence by the preceding term. If the resulting quotients are equal, then the sequence is geometric.

What is the difference between an arithmetic sequence and a geometric sequence?

Describe how exponential functions and geometric sequences are similar. How are they different?
Both geometric sequences and exponential functions have a constant ratio. However, their domains are not the same. Exponential functions are defined for all real numbers, and geometric sequences are defined only for positive integers. Another difference is that the base of a geometric sequence (the common ratio) can be negative, but the base of an exponential function must be positive.

Use the recursive formula to write a geometric sequence whose common ratio is an integer. Show the first four terms, and then find the 10th term.

Use the explicit formula to write a geometric sequence whose common ratio is a decimal number between 0 and 1. Show the first 4 terms, and then find the 8th term.

Answers will vary. Example: Explicit formula with a decimal common ratio: 
 
  
   a

  =400⋅
   
    0.5
   
   
    n−1

Is it possible for a sequence to be both arithmetic and geometric? If so, give an example.

common ratio
the ratio between any two consecutive terms in a geometric sequence

geometric sequence
a sequence in which the ratio of a term to a previous term is a constant
