Objective 2: Evaluate the square root of a negative number (IA 8.8.1)Imaginary numbers result when we try to take the square root of a negative number. They do not belong to the set of real numbers and so are called imaginary or complex. We will see complex solutions when we solve quadratic equations whose graph does not touch the x-axis. Imaginary numbers are used in many real-life applications including the study of electricity involving alternating current (AC) electronics. Wireless, cellular and radar technologies utilize imaginary numbers. Electrical engineers use imaginary numbers to measure the amplitude and phase of electrical oscillations.Important Facts to Remember:-1=i (a complex, or imaginary number)

Discovered by Benoit Mandelbrot around 1980, the Mandelbrot Set is one of the most recognizable fractal images. The image is built on the theory of self-similarity and the operation of iteration. Zooming in on a fractal image brings many surprises, particularly in the high level of repetition of detail that appears as magnification increases. The equation that generates this image turns out to be rather simple.
In order to better understand it, we need to become familiar with a new set of numbers. Keep in mind that the study of mathematics continuously builds upon itself. Negative integers, for example, fill a void left by the set of positive integers. The set of rational numbers, in turn, fills a void left by the set of integers. The set of real numbers fills a void left by the set of rational numbers. Not surprisingly, the set of real numbers has voids as well. In this section, we will explore a set of numbers that fills voids in the set of real numbers and find out how to work within it.
Expressing Square Roots of Negative Numbers as Multiples of 
 
 i
 
 
We know how to find the square root of any positive real number. In a similar way, we can find the square root of any negative number. The difference is that the root is not real. If the value in the radicand is negative, the root is said to be an imaginary number. The imaginary number 
 
 i
 
 is defined as the square root of 
 
 −1.
 
 
 
 
  
   
    −1
   
  
  =i
 
 
So, using properties of radicals,
 
 
  
   i
   2
  
  =
   
    (
     
      
       
        −1
       
      

     
    )
   
   2
  
  =−1
 
 
We can write the square root of any negative number as a multiple of 
 
 i.
 
 Consider the square root of 
 
 −49.
 
 
 
 
  
   
    −49
    =
    
     
      
       
        49⋅(−1)
      
      
    
   
   
    
    =
    
     
      
       
        49
      
      
       
        −1
      
      
    
   
   
    
    =
    7i
   

  
 We use 
 
 7i
 
 and not 
 
 −7i
 
 because the principal root of 
 
 49
 
 is the positive root.
A complex number is the sum of a real number and an imaginary number. A complex number is expressed in standard form when written 
 
 a+bi
 
 where 
 
 a
 
 is the real part and 
 
 b
 
 is the imaginary part. For example, 
 
 5+2i
 
 is a complex number. So, too, is 
 
 3+4i
   3
  
  .
 
 

  
 
Imaginary numbers differ from real numbers in that a squared imaginary number produces a negative real number. Recall that when a positive real number is squared, the result is a positive real number and when a negative real number is squared, the result is also a positive real number. Complex numbers consist of real and imaginary numbers.

Imaginary and Complex Numbers
A complex number is a number of the form 
 
 a+bi
 
 where
 
 
  a
 
 is the real part of the complex number.
 
 
  b
 
 is the imaginary part of the complex number.
If 
 
 b=0,
 
 then 
 
 a+bi
 
 is a real number. If 
 
 a=0
 
 and 
 
 b
 
 is not equal to 0, the complex number is called a pure imaginary number. An imaginary number is an even root of a negative number.

Plotting a Complex Number on the Complex Plane

We cannot plot complex numbers on a number line as we might real numbers. However, we can still represent them graphically. To represent a complex number, we need to address the two components of the number. We use the complex plane, which is a coordinate system in which the horizontal axis represents the real component and the vertical axis represents the imaginary component. Complex numbers are the points on the plane, expressed as ordered pairs 
 
 (a,b),
 
 where 
 
 a
 
 represents the coordinate for the horizontal axis and 
 
 b
 
 represents the coordinate for the vertical axis.Let’s consider the number 
 
 −2+3i.
 
 The real part of the complex number is 
 
 −2
 
 and the imaginary part is 3. We plot the ordered pair 
 
 (−2,3)
 
 to represent the complex number 
 
 −2+3i,
 
 as shown in .

Complex Plane
In the complex plane, the horizontal axis is the real axis, and the vertical axis is the imaginary axis, as shown in .

How To
Given a complex number, represent its components on the complex plane.

Determine the real part and the imaginary part of the complex number.
Move along the horizontal axis to show the real part of the number.

Adding and Subtracting Complex Numbers
Just as with real numbers, we can perform arithmetic operations on complex numbers. To add or subtract complex numbers, we combine the real parts and then combine the imaginary parts.

Multiplying Complex Numbers
Multiplying complex numbers is much like multiplying binomials. The major difference is that we work with the real and imaginary parts separately.

Multiplying a Complex Number by a Real Number
Lets begin by multiplying a complex number by a real number. We distribute the real number just as we would with a binomial. Consider, for example, 
 
 3(
   
    6+2i
   
  )
 
 :

Multiplying Complex Numbers Together
Now, let’s multiply two complex numbers. We can use either the distributive property or more specifically the FOIL method because we are dealing with binomials.

 it equals

Dividing Complex NumbersDividing two complex numbers is more complicated than adding, subtracting, or multiplying because we cannot divide by an imaginary number, meaning that any fraction must have a real-number denominator to write the answer in standard form 
 
 a+bi.
 
 We need to find a term by which we can multiply the numerator and the denominator that will eliminate the imaginary portion of the denominator so that we end up with a real number as the denominator. This term is called the complex conjugate of the denominator, which is found by changing the sign of the imaginary part of the complex number. In other words, the complex conjugate of 
 
 a+bi
 
 is 
 
 a−bi.
 
 For example, the product of 
 
 a+bi
 
 and 
 
 a−bi
 
 is
 
 
  
   
    (a+bi)(a−bi)
    =
    
     
      
       a
       2
      
      −abi+abi−

      +
       b
       2
      
      
    
   

  

The result is a real number.
Note that complex conjugates have an opposite relationship: The complex conjugate of 
 
 a+bi
 
 is 
 
 a−bi,
 
 and the complex conjugate of 
 
 a−bi
 
 is 
 
 a+bi.
 
 Further, when a quadratic equation with real coefficients has complex solutions, the solutions are always complex conjugates of one another.
Suppose we want to divide 
 
 c+di
 
 by 
 
 a+bi,
 
 where neither 
 
 a
 
 nor 
 
 b
 
 equals zero. We first write the division as a fraction, then find the complex conjugate of the denominator, and multiply.

The Complex Conjugate
The complex conjugate of a complex number 
 
 a+bi
 
 is 
 
 a−bi.
 
 It is found by changing the sign of the imaginary part of the complex number. The real part of the number is left unchanged.

When a complex number is multiplied by its complex conjugate, the result is a real number.
When a complex number is added to its complex conjugate, the result is a real number.

Simplifying Powers of iThe powers of 
 
 i
 
 are cyclic. Let’s look at what happens when we raise 
 
 i
 
 to increasing powers.

 We can see that when we get to the fifth power of 
 
 i,
 
 it is equal to the first power. As we continue to multiply 
 
 i
 
 by increasing powers, we will see a cycle of four. Let’s examine the next four powers of 
 
 i.

 The cycle is repeated continuously: 
 
 i,−1,−i,1,
 
 every four powers.

Since 
 
 
   i
   4
  
  =1,
 
 we can simplify the problem by factoring out as many factors of 
 
 
   i
   4
  

 
 as possible. To do so, first determine how many times 4 goes into 35: 
 
 35=4⋅8+3.

Q&A
Can we write

    35
   
  

 
 in other helpful ways?
As we saw in , we reduced 
 
 
   i
   
    35
   
  

 
 to 
 
 
   i
   3
  

 
 by dividing the exponent by 4 and using the remainder to find the simplified form. But perhaps another factorization of 
 
 
   i
   
    35
   
  

 
 may be more useful.  shows some other possible factorizations.

Key Concepts

The square root of any negative number can be written as a multiple of 
 
 i.
 
 See .
To plot a complex number, we use two number lines, crossed to form the complex plane. The horizontal axis is the real axis, and the vertical axis is the imaginary axis. See .
Complex numbers can be added and subtracted by combining the real parts and combining the imaginary parts. See .
Complex numbers can be multiplied and divided.

To multiply complex numbers, distribute just as with polynomials. See  and .
To divide complex numbers, multiply both numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator to eliminate the complex number from the denominator. See  and .

The powers of 
 
 i
 
 are cyclic, repeating every fourth one. See .
