Equations that include an exponential expression ax are called exponential equations. There are two types of exponential equations: those with the common base on each side, and those without a common base.
Type 1: Possible common base on each side: Use properties of exponents to rewrite each side with a common base. Use base-exponent property to set exponents equal to each other and solve for x.Base-Exponent PropertyFor any a>0, a≠1, if ax=ay then x=y Type 2: No possible common base: Use properties of exponents to rewrite each side in terms of one exponential expression. Take the log or ln of each side and use the power rule to bring down the power. Solve the remaining equation for x.

Objective 2: Solving Logarithmic Equations.  (IA 10.3.4)
There are two types of logarithmic equations: those with log terms on just one side of the equation or those with log terms on each side of the equation.  Since the domain of logarithmic functions is positive numbers only, make sure to check the solutions.Type 1: Log terms on one side of the equation: Use properties of logs to rewrite a side with just one log term. Convert to exponential notation and solve for x.If logax=y then x=ay .Type 2: Log terms on both sides of equation: First, use log properties to rewrite each side in terms of a single log expression, if necessary. Use the one-to-one property of logarithmic equality to set arguments equal to one another.

Wild rabbits in Australia. The rabbit population grew so quickly in Australia that the event became known as the “rabbit plague.” (credit: Richard Taylor, Flickr)In 1859, an Australian landowner named Thomas Austin released 24 rabbits into the wild for hunting. Because Australia had few predators and ample food, the rabbit population exploded. In fewer than ten years, the rabbit population numbered in the millions.

Uncontrolled population growth, as in the wild rabbits in Australia, can be modeled with exponential functions. Equations resulting from those exponential functions can be solved to analyze and make predictions about exponential growth. In this section, we will learn techniques for solving exponential functions.

Using Like Bases to Solve Exponential Equations

The first technique involves two functions with like bases. Recall that the one-to-one property of exponential functions tells us that, for any real numbers 

b,

 

S,

 and 

T,

 where 

b>0,b≠1,

 

b
S

=
b
T

 if and only if 

S=T.

 In other words, when an exponential equation has the same base on each side, the exponents must be equal. This also applies when the exponents are algebraic expressions. Therefore, we can solve many exponential equations by using the rules of exponents to rewrite each side as a power with the same base. Then, we use the fact that exponential functions are one-to-one to set the exponents equal to one another, and solve for the unknown.For example, consider the equation 

3

4x−7

=

3

2x

3

.
 To solve for 

x,

 we use the division property of exponents to rewrite the right side so that both sides have the common base, 

3.
 Then we apply the one-to-one property of exponents by setting the exponents equal to one another and solving for 

x

Rewriting Equations So All Powers Have the Same Base

Sometimes the common base for an exponential equation is not explicitly shown. In these cases, we simply rewrite the terms in the equation as powers with a common base, and solve using the one-to-one property.For example, consider the equation 

256=
4

x−5

.
 We can rewrite both sides of this equation as a power of 

2.
 Then we apply the rules of exponents, along with the one-to-one property, to solve for 

x:

  
 
  
   
    
     
      256=
       4
       
        x−5

Q&A
Do all exponential equations have a solution? If not, how can we tell if there is a solution during the problem-solving process?
No. Recall that the range of an exponential function is always positive. While solving the equation, we may obtain an expression that is undefined.

Solving an Equation with Positive and Negative Powers
Solve 

3

x+1

=−2.

 

This equation has no solution. There is no real value of 

x
 that will make the equation a true statement because any power of a positive number is positive.

Analysis 
 shows that the two graphs do not cross so the left side is never equal to the right side. Thus the equation has no solution.

2
x

Solving Exponential Equations Using Logarithms

Sometimes the terms of an exponential equation cannot be rewritten with a common base. In these cases, we solve by taking the logarithm of each side. Recall, since 

log(
a
)=log(
b
)
 is equivalent to 

a=b,

 we may apply logarithms with the same base on both sides of an exponential equation.
How To
Given an exponential equation in which a common base cannot be found, solve for the unknown.
Apply the logarithm of both sides of the equation.
If one of the terms in the equation has base 10, use the common logarithm.
If none of the terms in the equation has base 10, use the natural logarithm.

Use the rules of logarithms to solve for the unknown.

Extraneous Solutions

Sometimes the methods used to solve an equation introduce an extraneous solution, which is a solution that is correct algebraically but does not satisfy the conditions of the original equation. One such situation arises in solving when the logarithm is taken on both sides of the equation. In such cases, remember that the argument of the logarithm must be positive. If the number we are evaluating in a logarithm function is negative, there is no output.

Analysis 
When we plan to use factoring to solve a problem, we always get zero on one side of the equation, because zero has the unique property that when a product is zero, one or both of the factors must be zero. We reject the equation 

e
x

=−7
 because a positive number never equals a negative number. The solution 

ln(−7)
 is not a real number, and in the real number system this solution is rejected as an extraneous solution.

Q&A
Does every logarithmic equation have a solution?
No. Keep in mind that we can only apply the logarithm to a positive number. Always check for extraneous solutions.

Using the Definition of a Logarithm to Solve Logarithmic Equations
We have already seen that every logarithmic equation 

log

b

(
x
)=y
 is equivalent to the exponential equation

For example, consider the equation 

log

2

(
2

log

2

(

3x−5

Using the One-to-One Property of Logarithms to Solve Logarithmic Equations

As with exponential equations, we can use the one-to-one property to solve logarithmic equations. The one-to-one property of logarithmic functions tells us that, for any real numbers 

x>0,

 

S>0,

 

T>0
 and any positive real number 

b,

 where 

b≠1,

  

log

b

S=

log

b

Tif and only if S=T.

For example, 

If  

log

2

(x−1)=

log

2

(8),then x−1=8.

So, if 

x−1=8,

 then we can solve for 

x,

 and we get 

x=9.
 To check, we can substitute 

x=9
 into the original equation: 

log

2

(

9−1

)=

log

2

(
8
)=3.
 In other words, when a logarithmic equation has the same base on each side, the arguments must be equal. This also applies when the arguments are algebraic expressions. Therefore, when given an equation with logs of the same base on each side, we can use rules of logarithms to rewrite each side as a single logarithm. Then we use the fact that logarithmic functions are one-to-one to set the arguments equal to one another and solve for the unknown.

For example, consider the equation 

log(

3x−2

)−log(
2
)=log(

x+4

).
 To solve this equation, we can use the rules of logarithms to rewrite the left side as a single logarithm, and then apply the one-to-one property to solve for 

x:

 

 
 
  
   
    
     
      log(3x−2)−log(2)=log(x+4)
     
    
    
     
    
   
   
    
     log(
       
        
         
          3x−2
         
         2
        

       
      )=log(x+4)
     
    
    
     
      Apply the quotient rule of logarithms.
     
    
   
   
    
     
       
        3x−2
       
       2
      
      =x+4
     
    
    
     
      Apply the one to one property of a logarithm.
     
    
   
   
    
     3x−2=2x+8
     
    
    
     
      Multiply both sides of the equation by 2.
     
    
   
   
    
     x=10
     
    
    
     
      Subtract 2xand add 2.
     
    
   

  
 

To check the result, substitute 

x=10
 into 

log(

3x−2

)−log(
2
)=log(

x+4

).

 

 
 
  
   
    
     
      log(3(10)−2)−log(2)=log((10)+4)
     
    
    
     
    
   
   
    
     log(28)−log(2)=log(14)
     
    
    
     
    
   
   
    
     log(
       
        
         
          28

Solving Applied Problems Using Exponential and Logarithmic Equations
In previous sections, we learned the properties and rules for both exponential and logarithmic functions. We have seen that any exponential function can be written as a logarithmic function and vice versa. We have used exponents to solve logarithmic equations and logarithms to solve exponential equations. We are now ready to combine our skills to solve equations that model real-world situations, whether the unknown is in an exponent or in the argument of a logarithm.

One such application is in science, in calculating the time it takes for half of the unstable material in a sample of a radioactive substance to decay, called its half-life.  lists the half-life for several of the more common radioactive substances.

We can see how widely the half-lives for these substances vary. Knowing the half-life of a substance allows us to calculate the amount remaining after a specified time. We can use the formula for radioactive decay:

Key Concepts
We can solve many exponential equations by using the rules of exponents to rewrite each side as a power with the same base. Then we use the fact that exponential functions are one-to-one to set the exponents equal to one another and solve for the unknown.
When we are given an exponential equation where the bases are explicitly shown as being equal, set the exponents equal to one another and solve for the unknown. See .
When we are given an exponential equation where the bases are not explicitly shown as being equal, rewrite each side of the equation as powers of the same base, then set the exponents equal to one another and solve for the unknown. See , , and .
When an exponential equation cannot be rewritten with a common base, solve by taking the logarithm of each side. See .
We can solve exponential equations with base 

e,

 by applying the natural logarithm of both sides because exponential and logarithmic functions are inverses of each other. See  and .
After solving an exponential equation, check each solution in the original equation to find and eliminate any extraneous solutions. See .
When given an equation of the form 

log

b

(S)=c,

 where 

S

 is an algebraic expression, we can use the definition of a logarithm to rewrite the equation as the equivalent exponential equation 

b
c

=S,

 and solve for the unknown. See  and .
We can also use graphing to solve equations with the form 

log

b

(S)=c.
 We graph both equations 

y=

log

b

(S)
 and 

y=c
 on the same coordinate plane and identify the solution as the x-value of the intersecting point. See .
When given an equation of the form 

log

b

S=

log

b

T,

 where 

S
 and 

T
 are algebraic expressions, we can use the one-to-one property of logarithms to solve the equation 

S=T
 for the unknown. See .
Combining the skills learned in this and previous sections, we can solve equations that model real world situations, whether the unknown is in an exponent or in the argument of a logarithm. See .

How can an exponential equation be solved?

Determine first if the equation can be rewritten so that each side uses the same base. If so, the exponents can be set equal to each other. If the equation cannot be rewritten so that each side uses the same base, then apply the logarithm to each side and use properties of logarithms to solve.

When does an extraneous solution occur? How can an extraneous solution be recognized?

When can the one-to-one property of logarithms be used to solve an equation? When can it not be used?

The one-to-one property can be used if both sides of the equation can be rewritten as a single logarithm with the same base. If so, the arguments can be set equal to each other, and the resulting equation can be solved algebraically. The one-to-one property cannot be used when each side of the equation cannot be rewritten as a single logarithm with the same base.
